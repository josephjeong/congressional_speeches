1135168,510015696,"I thank my colleague for his courtesy. In the Third Congress. Mr. Speaker. when that Congress assembled. on the 2d day of December. 1793. on the very same day a similar resolution to the one i have just referred to was adopted. that the rules of the former Congress should be adopted by that House and be the rules of procedure governing that body until changed or altered. The Fourth Congress met on the 7th day of December. 1795. and adopted a similar resolution. providing that the rules of the last House be established as the rules to govern the proceedings of that House until altered or amended. And soon down acareful examination ofthe Journal of the proceedings of every session. from the First Congress to the first session of the Fiftyfirst Congress. every one that has assembled and every House of Representatives. shows that the very first action which was taken after organization. after the election of the Speaker and other officers. was to adopt a code of procedure for the House. But this. the first Congress that has assembled in the second century of our constitutional existence as a nation. is marked by a characteristic and a wide contrast in this respect. When we met on the 2d day of December last. instead of following an unbroken line of precedents so long pursued in this body. my distinguished colleague offered a very innocentlooking resolution. couched in different terms from that offered in every preceding Congress. It was that the rules of the Fiftieth Congress should be referred to the Committee on Rules of this body when appointed. In that innocentlooking little resolution were hidden and covered up the seeds of the unseemly contest that has been thereby precipitated upon us since. There was a purpose in it. and it was frankly disclosed by the gentleman from Iowa in his rampant speech on yesterday. What was that purpose? When this House assembled the roll of membership showed that of the 330 members there were 169 occupying seats on that side of the Chamber and 161 on this. or. in other words. only three more on that side than were required to make a quorum. a very narrow margin. upon that side of thellouse. Members of Congress. Mr. Speaker. like other people. are subject to the vicissitudes of life. Death will invade our ranks. Sickness will attack us. men here are also subjected to the cares and obligations of business life. and it is almost a matter of physical impossibility to have at all times a full attendance of membership. This is a misfortune which that side as well as this must bear. We witnessed that condition of affairs at the organization of this House. when there was only a bare quorum of the other side present to effect the organization. And. Mr. Speaker. only on one other occasion. to which I have already referred. has the rollcall disclosed a full quorum of the membership of that side of the House. The purpose was evident in view of the large number of contestedelection cases pending. in which the contestant was on that side and the sitting member on this side of the House. and to expedite the disposal of these cases a course of procedure was resorted to that was better calculated to "" facilitate business. "" I to use an expression of which we have heard so much lately in the course of this debate. Hence the policy of "" no rules."" and the inauguration in this House of that new dispensation. ""general parliamentary law."" But the protest went up from this side of the House and to the country against that extraordinary and unjustifiable rule. Wedemanded. in view of that long and unbroken line of precedents. that a code of rules should be presented and adopted to regulate the transaction of business. and out of their own mouths do members on that side of the House stand convicted. for. notwithstanding the unprecedented ruling of the Speaker in counting a quorum outside of the record. yet when you came to vote on the contestedelection case you refused to rely upon the extraordinary rulings of the Speaker. and delayed the vote and managed it so that the roll was not called until you had every member who was able (even some. at least one. at the risk of their lives) in his seat until the rollcall was completed. and disclosed of itself a quorum voting on that question. Why the necessity for so doing if you were sincere and confident in the correctness and soundness of the Speakers extraordinary rulings? More than that. you thereupon immediately abandoned that policy. and. fearing to voyage further on that unexplored and stormy sea of general parliamentary law. you surrendered. and now propose to shield yourselves under a new code of rules. We have reason to congratulate ourselves on this side in having at least acconplished so much. for. objectionable as some of the rules are. they are infinitely better than general parliamentary law as we have scen it administered here. Now. sir. in addition to this. we have a most extraordinarydeparture in the very rule to the clause of which I have offered the amendment I have now presented. asking to strike out a certain part of it. I regard it as a very dangerous proposition. and propose at this time to confine my remarks to this feature of the proposed rules. although there are many other most objectionable features in them. Let me. than. Mr. Speaker. briefly address myself to the proposition involved in this rule. which. in violation of and opposition to all previous rulings. proposes to confer upon the Speaker of this House the power. of his own motion. to count a quorum by adding names to the Journal. The Constitution requires Ihe House to keep a Journal o1 its proceedings. and upon the demand of onefifth of the members that the yeas and nays shall be recorded thereon upon the passage of any ineasure before the House. It has. up to this time. been uniformly held by every presiding officer bf every political party who has occupied that chair that when the rollcall so ordered discloses the absence ofa quorum there is no appeal from that record. It is the ascertainment of the fact in an official manner. in the manner provided and required by the Constitution. and the reason for this is apparent. Now. sir. under the proposed rule the effectwill be tohave the Journal show a contradiction. the rollcall disclosing the absence of a quorum and the mere. naked. unsupported declaration of the Speaker that certain members were present and did not vote. without any check or limit to his power. naming members without any means of correcting a mistake. not done in an official capacity nor as expressive of any action taken by the House in regard thereto. but purely and simply of his own motion and at his own caprice and will naming such members as he pleases and as proposed by the rule. just sufficient to constitute a quorum. This certainly in a body like this or any other public body is an extraordinary power to place in the hands of one man. It is antiAmerican. it is contrary to the theory and principle of our free institutions. The theory of our friends seems to be in presenting this code of rules that the majority have all rights. This I concede in so far as they exercise and assert their rights and powers according to the laws of the laud. for the American people are a lawabiding people. Itis the glory of our race and country that we bow in humble submission to the laws of the land as the one sovereign to whom our people yield allegiance. Now. although I apprehend it will prove of no avail. yet it may be wholesome to calmly review the record in this particular. The question. so far as I have been able to discover. was first raised in the first session of the Twentyninth Congress. Speaker Davis. of Illinois. in the chair. In the Journal of the first session. on page 356. it will be found that upon ruling upon this very question he held that ""it appearing from the record there was not a quorum present no motion was in order except a call of the House or to adjourn."" The same ruling was held in the second session of the Twentyninth Congress and also in the second session of the Thirtieth Congress. The question was again decided in the second session of the Fortysecond Congress. where the Speaker in that instance used the following language. when it appeared upon a rollcall that a quorum was not present. In passing upon the question then raised as to the right of the House to proceed. he heldThat the Iouse thereby becomes constitutionally disqualified to do further business. except that which the Constitution authorizes the House to do when a quorum is not present. i. e.. to adjourn or order a call of the House. And as has been already referred to by a number of gentlemen who have preceeded me. I cite the rulings of that universally admitted eminent authority on parliamentary law. Speaker Blaine. when this question was raised in the Fortythird Congress.",1890-02-13,Mr. REILLY,D,13.0,JAMES,REILLY,H,M,PA
1150965,510031493,"Mr. Speaker. across yon majestic river. in sight of this Capitol. lies a land remarkable not alone for the beauty of its scenery and fertility of its soil. but a wonderland. renowned and revered wherever the truth and beauty of glorious womanhood are respected and the strength and grandeur of a splendid manhood treasured. It can boast generation after generation of strong statesmen who had wisdom without conceit and learning without pedantry. of warriors who were valorous. but not oppressivegrand as Achilles in war and humble as Cincinnatus in peace. There the magnificent and fiery spirit of her sons is surpassed only by the beauty and loveliness of her daughters. From Virginias hills and Virginias vales. following the star of empire westward. her sons and daughters have wended their way. Wherever they have gone they have carried with them a hospitality which knew no stint and a love of orderly. constitutional government which knew no limit. In every State. from the Chesapeake to the Golden Gate. the sturdy sons of the mother of States and statesmen are found in the forum. in the field. in the factory. everywhere illustrating the integrity of man. advocating the rights of man. and advancing the material interests of man. From such a stock and such a State sprang Edward J. Gay. Born in 1816. he was taken from Virginia to Illinois in 1820. and removed thence to St. Louis. Mo.. in 1824. This city. now one of the wonders of the century and the country. was then but a small town. He maybe said to have grown with its growth and strengthened with its strength. It is not my purpose. nor would this occasion permit me. to detail all the important events in the life of this distinguished citizen and statesman. He was fortunate in youth in being placed under an ediucator of fine ability. under whom he made not only satisfactory but rapid progress. Reaching manhood his tastes turned strongly to business rather than professional pursuits. and he entered upon a mercantile life. His chief characteristics were untiring assiduity. unswerving integrity. and boldness. After calm deliberation he reached his own conclusions and stood by them and defended them. He struck boldly out in his mercantile pursuits and went to orient or occident for what his trade demanded. Moved by this spirit. Mr. HEARD has told you he was the first to import coffee from the West Indies to St. Louis. He married a fair daughter of Tennessee. Miss Lavinia Hynes. in 1840. who survives him. In 1856 he moved to Louisiana. where most of his latter life was spent and from which he was sent as a Representative in Congress. Mr. Speaker. in this busy age and progressive land. fortunate is that man who can leave a lasting impression on any State of this Union. But such was the power of this man that youmay blot out either his record here or his life in St. Louis or his life in Louisiana. or any two of them. and there remains enough of fame for him to allow posterity to rank him a distinguished American citizen. It was not my good fortune to meet Mr. Gay till he came here as a member of the Fortyninth Congress. From that time on I knew him well. In the Fiftieth Congress we occupied seats so near each other that I saw him daily and hourly when the House was in session. I had thereby an opportunity to become thoroughly acquainted with him and observe his actions. As a man he was calm. selfpossessed. and meditative. He reached conclusions. as I have stated. after thoughtful consideration. and adhered to them with great tenacity. He was modest but firm. courteous but bold. As a legislator he was ever vigilant in looking to the interests of the great State he represented and the grand country of which it was a part. Those acquainted with his business affairs knew how exacting were the demands of his private interests. But while here he made these subservient to his public duties. as he should. and never allowed private affairs. however important. to take the time which he had agreed by the acceptance of his high office to dedicate to the public. Placed on account of his recognized ability on the Committee on Appropriations. the latter years of his life were devoted to the study of those economic questions involved in the appropriation of hundreds of millions of money in the government of sixty millions of people. How vell this duty was discharged his vigilant attendance here and the records of his country attest. But the end came after more than three score and ten years. He had found the valley of that great river a wilderness and a canebrake. He had helped to clear away its forests. to spread the wings of commerce over its waste of waters. and to people its valleys. He had seen the blighting hand of civil war fall upon the blooming land and seen it wither. He had seen misgovernment. worse than war. hover over the land long after the smoke of battle had been lifted. But instead of being discouraged by calamity he was nerved by it. Disaster after disaster was succeeded by struggle after struggle till the land that was in tears smiled again. Looking back to the past and remembering what a potent factor he bad been. not only in building up the country originally. but in rehabilitating it. ir. Gay could say with gladness what Othello said in sadness: ""I have done the state some service."" Looking to the future and remembering that he had years before professed faith in the blessed Redeemer. he could triumphantly exclaim: I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Four States boasted being the place of his residence. More than forty States mourn his death.",1890-03-22,Mr. MoMILLIN,D,4.0,BENTON,MCMILLIN,H,M,TN

1167632,510048160,I do not takeany pride in attacking the report. because I recognize the fact that there ought to be a government there for this Territory. but I do think this is the most incongruous. heterogeneous. and contradictory piece of legislation I have ever seen. This is simply one of the first sections. The whole bill all the way through seems to have been put in by parcels. as Desdemona listened to Othellos story of his military exploits and dangers by flood and field. It seems as if everybody who came along with a suggestion got it into this bill.,1890-04-23,Mr. VEST,,, ,VEST,S,M, 
1177391,510057919,"in his report. says: The committee have given months of investigation to the existing conditions of agriculture and matters connected therewith. It is strange that such an investigation did not stay the heavy hand of taxation that has so long been laid on the farmer. In another place he says: A critical examination of the subject will show that agriculture Is suffering chiefly from a most damaging competition in our home market. The increale of importations of agricultural products since 1850 has been enormous. mounting from $40.000.000 to more than $56.000.000 in 1889. It will be seen that he takes a period of nearly forty years in which this increase was made. during which time he says the population of the country increased less than 300 per cent.. and it is to be observed that Mr. McKINLEY furnishes no bill of particulars in this connection showing in what these importations of agricultural products consisted. Is it at all strange that during a* period in which our population increased with such amazing rapidity the importations of such agricultural products as sugar. coffee. and the tropical fruits. noneof which. except sugar. can be successfully crown in this country. should have largely increased? Mr. Chairman. when the Republican majority of the Committee on Ways and Means were giving months of investigation to the existing conditions of agriculture and matters connected therewith."" it would have been no more than right for them to direct their eyes towards the South with no unkin dly spirit. It may be said that the South pays not less than onethird of the revenues of this Government and gets but little of it back in the disbursement of the public funds. Of the vast sum that is expended for pensions. now amounting to more than $100..000.000 annually. the South receives but little. The disbursement of the pension fund among the people of the North very largely contributes to their prosperity. but pensions only assist in impoverishing the people of the South. but of this the South has not complained. The matchless energies of her people have enabled the South to bear these burdens. But the people of the South have the right to ask for at least fair treatment in the preparation of a bill like the one under consideration. Is there anything in the pending bill that will help the agricultural interests of the South? If there is I have notbeen able tofind it. Cotton is the staple production in most of the Southern States. but as it has no foreign competition. for no cotton is imported to this country. it has received no consideration in this measure. although the cultivation of cotton is one of our largest industries and is also one of our largest exports. I have before called your attention to the fact that th farmers engaged in raising cotton have suffered much from.the depression in prices. Why not relieve the cottongrowers of a part of the onerous taxation imposed upon them? Will it be said that the placing of jute and jute butts on the freelist will relieve them ? I doubt whether it will do so to any appreciable extent. but if bagging manufactured for wrapping cotton and the iron tiesused therewith had been placed on the freelist. it would have been of much benefit to the cottonplanter. But the committee would not do that. because it would interfere with some of the ""American industries."" to the maintenance of which the people of the South must be made to contribute by onerous taxation. Sugar is another Southern product. In the State of Texas there is an area of territory larger than the State of Louisiana which is capable of growing sugar. There are some very large sugar plantations in my State. and the growing of sugar is a matter in which the people of Texas have much interest. In the near future it promises to be one of our large industries. In the last fiscal year the total amount of revenue derived from custom duties amounted to $223.832.741.69. and of this amount the duties on sugar and molasses furnished the sum of $55.975.610. But. notwithstanding onefourth of the entire revenue has been derived from sugar and molasses. this bill places these articles on the freelist. Do our Republican friends of the Committee on Ways and Means understand that Southern industries are included in the term ""American industries ?"" It is true that a bounty of 2 cents per pound is to be paid on sugar up to a certain grade that maybe produced in this country for the next fifteen years. This bounty system is all wrong and no such precedent should be established. It is claimed that bounties will encourage the production of sugar. that they will lead to such development of the sorghumand sugarbeet industries as will supply the people of the United States with all the sugar they need by the time the fifteen years expire. Whether the j uice from sorghum can be granulated into sugar at such cost as to make its use practicable depends upon the inventive genius of man. and no bounty will bring it about. nor will it incite further or more strenuous efforts in that direction. The exclusive privileges of a patent give greater profit to the inventor than a bounty conferred upon the grower. and when the process of making sugar from sorghum is rendered practicable it will require no bounty from the Government to induce the farmers to grow it. Soil and climate are the indispensable requisites for successful culture of the sugarbeet. and when these are found aid from the Government will not be required. Why should the man who raises wheat or corn or cotton be taxed to provide a bounty or the man who raises sugar? I do not perceive why the corngrower may not as well be taxed for the benefit of the sugargrower as to be taxed for the benefit of the woolgrower and for the benefit of the manufacturer of woolen goods. The sugargrower needs as much protection from the cheap labor of the West Indies and other sugargrowing countries as do those who manufacture glassware or woolen goods from what the protectionists are pleased to call the ""pauper labor of Europe."" lut it is all wrong. It is class legislation. No industry should be taxed in order to increase the profits of another industry. It is not fair play. I do not think there is any sincere belief on the part of many that bounties on sugar will be long paid. Such legislation is presented at this time to let the sugar industry ""down easy."" I would not le surprised if the bounty clause was repealed at the next session of Congress. If there is any one who believes that bounties on sugar will be paid for the nextfifteen years I think his credulity is far greater than his judgment. I do not wish from these remarks to be understood as defending the present duties on sugar. for I am no more a protectionist at the South than I am at the North. and nowhere is the doctrine of "" protection fbr the sake of protection"" right. I think the duty on sugar should be reduced to at least the extent made in the Mills bill. but I do wish to bbo distinctly understood as protesting against the unjust discrimination made in the pending bill against the industries of the South. The majority report which accompanies this bill justifies the action of the committee in placing sugar on the freelist. because ""it is an article of prime necessity as food."" Salt is also an article of ""prime necessity as food"" and is not on the freelist. It may be true that there is not as much salt required for family use as there is of sugar. but even that is doubtful. It is found in all the smokeh6uses of the farmers and is in more universal use than sugar. Salt is used by both man and beast. and in all the great packiughouses of the North it is an article of indispensable necessity. Not long since I read the following statement in a newspaper: The great packing firm of Armour & Co.. of Chicago. import all the salt that they use in packing from Canada. and pay duty at the rate of 8 cents per sack and 12 cents per barrel. then when they have packed their pork with it and export their pork. they. under the ruling of the Treasury Department. receive their duty back on the number of pounds of salt in each barrel. This rebate I was informed amountedto nearly a million of dollars per annum. I do not know whether this statement is true or false. but it serves to show the extensive use of salt. It is not only used in packinghouses. but in canneries and in various kinds of manufacturing establishments to be found in the Northern States. If sugar is placed on the freelist because it is an article of prime necessity I fail to see why salt also should not be made free. Salt is mostly manufactured in the North. sugar and molasses are mostly manufactured in the South. Rice is exclusively a Southern product. and has found no protection at the hands of the majority of the Ways and Means Committee. but foreign competition has been invited by a reduction of the duty on this article. Cottongrowers. sugargrowers. and ricegrowers of the South certainly form no part of the agricultural interests to which the majority of the Committee on Ways and Means "" gave months of investigation. "" I The South can stand it. and will submit to these unjust discriminations against her agricultural industries. with the hope that a better policy will prevail even with those who now shape the legislation of the country. Mr. Chairman. no more transparent fraud was ever attempted than is now being made by the Republican party in its effort to create the impression that the farmers of this country have been seriously damaged by the importation of agricultural products from other countries. The grain imported from Canada and other countries for planting and for other purposes is a mere bagatelle to the annual surplus of grain in this country for which no living price can be obtained. What the farmer needs is relief from the socalled "" protection""1 given to him by the Republican party. Cheapen those articles that he and his family are compelled to eat or to wear and the utensils with which they must work in the house and in the field. and upon which you now compel him to pay a tax of not less than 47 per cent.. and you will contribute more to his happiness and prosperity than you will ever accomplish by excluding cabbages from Canada or Spanish ponies from Mexico. When you attempt to discount the intellectual force and intelligence of the agriculturists of this country you make a great mistake. They will be quick to see the fraud that is attempted to be imposed upon them by this tariff bill. and in their own way and at the proper time will let you know it. I have spoken thus far in behalf of the farmer. but there are others who ""in the sweat of their faces eat bread."" The question of labor in these United States has ever been connected with revenue mlieasures. No one need be told that in the early days of this Republic the only defense urged in behalf of a protective tariff were the benefits to accrue therefrom to our ""infant industries. and if we are to believe our Republican friends the manufacturing industries of this country are still in their swaddling clothes. I am sure I never heard a speech or read an article in behalf of a protective tariff which did not claim that high protective duties were necessary for American labor. The benefits that will accrue to American laborers form the staple arguments of all protectionists. and without it Othellos occupation would be gone. I have never believed that a protective tariff was of any benefit to an American workman or to any one except the capitalist whose money was invested in manufacturing industries. nor have I had the slightest apprehension that American labor in this country could be injured by cheap labor in Europe. Every intelligent man is bound to admit that there have been more labor troubles in the last twentyfive years in this country than were ever known before. There have been more lock outs. strikes. and contentions of every kind between employers and employis than was ever before known. and all these things have occurred during the existence of the Morrill war tariff. the highest protective tariff that has ever been in existence in the United States. Will some protectionist explain why all this discontent and trouble have occurred during a period of high protection? It has been during this period that labor organizations have arisen. Men belonging to these organizations will tell you truly that the causes which render such organizations not only worthy. but absolutely necessary. are. ""First. the domination of capital. second. the inequalities of wealth and poverty before the law- third. the discriminations and exorbitancy of our system of taxation."" Will any one deny that these causes exist? Doe.. not every observing man know that they do exist? Yes. it is too true that the struggle for life is becoming more desperate and labor has been compelled to organize for resistance to the domination of capital. Mr. Chairman. these labor organizations do much good. they are educating the masses in regard to the practical questions of the day. and their hard experience and daily observations constitute a great store of learning to them of far more practical value than learned essays upon thesubject of political economy. It was but the otherday that I clipped from a labor paper the following: Another source of social disorder is the inequality of our system of taxation. If our direct system is viious. our in direct system isoutrageous. Though the .wealth is centered in the few the taxes are borne by the many. A poor man is taxed upon the face value of his freehold. The bondholder and the monopolist. Worth untold millions and living in a brownstone front upon some fashionable avenue. hand in their figures for assessment. And need I say that they are very kind to themselves? And now permit me t: say a word 4r regard to our indirect system. which is misnamed a protective tariff. It is or.ly protective inasmuch as it protects the rich and burdens the needy. Our present tariff has been defined. and well. as a ""tax which pillages the many to enrich the few."" It affords protection to a few manufacturers upon our coast to .he detriment of a majority of our people. While the price of manufactured articles is increased. there is no corresponding inc vase in wages. ""A tariff discri ninates against labor in favor of capital."" This is the truth and nothing but the truth told in a few words. I rejoice to know that the farmers. the mechanics. and all the workers of this land are investigating these practical questions in politicsquestions that so materially affect their business relations and success in lifefor I know they will find the truth. and truth will dissipate the heresies of a protective tariff. It would be strange. indeed. if some errors should not creep into these labor organizations. but we may Iely with perfect confidence upon their great common sense and experience in practical affairs to correct their mistakes. It is a great error upon the part of some belonging to these organizations to impute the wrongs under which they and the whole country suffer to both of the great political parties now in existence. The Democratic party is not justly chargeable with any of the evils which afflict the country. It should be remembered that the country is now suffering from the effects Df class legislation that has been enacted since the Republican party came into authority. and that at no time since the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln in March. 1861. have the Democrats had at any one period the President and both Houses of Congress. and that it has not been within the power of the Democratic party to relieve the country from the evils under which it has suffered from the class legislation of the Republican party. a party which has faithfully represented associated capital and corporate power. The history of the Democratic party will show that it has ever been the determined foe of class legislation and has always endeavored to have the Government so administered as to lighten the burden of taxation. and to legislate for no particular orprivileged class. but for the good of all. and it may be trusted to work in the future for that for which it has so faithfully laborcd in the past.",1890-05-08,Mir. MCKINLEY,R,18.0,WILLIAM,MCKINLEY,H,M,OH
1185853,510066381,"Mr. Chairman. at the outset I desire to call the attention of the House to the fact that this can not be tortured into a contest between the advocates of free trade upon one hand and the protective system upon the other. There is no considerable party in this country that believes in free trade. there never has been any question of free trade in the last twentyfive years. no one desires to raise that issue now. As long as the Government needs large sums of money for its maintenance and support and raises the great portion of that money by import duties there is no question of free trade. In stating the position which I assume and which I believe the great bulk of the Democratic party assumes. I can not better define my position than by quoting from the governor of my State of New York. when he declared himself not for ""free. but a freer trade."" Since then the conditions have been reversed. The dominant party in this House contends not for protection alone. we have had that for years.-they go further. they contend for a higher protection. They propose to revise the tariff by raising instead of lowering the duties. Thisis done upon the theory of encouraging the system of home production. a very specious theory. that proposes by the institution of the bounty system to manufacturers to make their business so good that they will employ many workmen and pay them high wages. and that this employment of workmen will be so general as to take up the surplus of American labor. and that they. the employed workmen. in turn will spend their money for the various necessaries of life and thereby create a home market for the farmer. I This is a beautiful theory. but. unfortunately for the theory. its practice during the last twentyfive years has shown the results hoped for by these theorists are just the results that we never attain. It is well to bear in mind that when the system of tariff under which duties are now collected was first imposed it was a war measure. and urged solely for the purpose of collecting the revenues necessary for war. No one at the time. no single advocate either in this House or in the Senate. urged it as a permanent tax upon the importers and consumers in this country. As the distinguished gentleman from Texas so well demonstrated in a speech upon tlw bill rs his name. delivered in April. 1888. this was.but one of the series of es. direct and indirect. laid XXI317 upon the people to produce the revenues necessary for the maintenance of our armies in the field. All the other taxes have been swept away. and thie one system stands today the surviving relic of the war taxes and has even grown In years of peace. And now in this House. when the entire country is groaning under the burden of excessive taxation. when business is prostrated. when the agricultural classes are weighed down by the burden of debt wellnigh hopeless. increasing from year to year. when our commerce is vanished and but a memory. when our workiugmen are groaning beneath the double burden of high prices for the necessaries of life and low wages given by these same manufacturers who reap the rich harvest of these bounties. at this time the proposal is made to reduce this taxation by increasing the duties and strengthening and stretching still further the doctrine of bounty and high protection. If there ever was any doubt in the mind of any single thinking man that this tariff wasa tax paid alike by every consumer of the country. not like other taxes in proportion to the wealth of the citizen. but in proportion alone to the amount of his consumption. this doubt has surely been removed by the admission of the very friends of this measure. When it is proposed to substitute for the protective duty on sugar a direct bounty as an equivalent to such duty. the last hope of the concealment of the real nature of this tariff imposition is swept away. Ah. but our friends in the majority say in the report which accompanies this bill. that ""they have not been so much concerned about the price of the articles we consume."" and again they ""believe that competition among ourselves will secure reasonable prices to consumers in the future as it has invariably done in the past."" All that depends upon vWhat gentlemen upon that committee believe to be reasonable prices. Competition in these lines has failed to secure to our people as cheap prices for goods as the protected manufacturers have sold the same goods to the more favored consumers in England and in other countries. and in proof of this I can not do better than quote from the New York Herald of the 9th of the present month: Under the present tari ff and before weget to McKinley prices. American axes cost American citizens 87.76 per dozen. but the same axes are sold by the same American manufacturers to foreigners for 56.75 per dozen. A plow for which the American farmer is charged by the American manufacturer $1L is sold to foreigners by the same manufacturer for $8.40. A plow for which the American manufacturer charges his fellowcitizen the American farmer. $5.60. the same man ufacturer sells to a foreigner for $5.03. For a gangplow the American manufacturer charges the American farmer 58.80.but he charges the foreigner only S52.92. For a dozen shovels the American manufacturer charges his fellowcitizens $9.20. but he lets the foreigner have them for 7.86. The copper lords having got in 1861 so heavy a duty on foreign copper ores as to exclude these ores entirely. and thus give them a monopoly of the celebrated ""home market."" have for many years sold the surplus copper in Europe a cent or two per pound cheaper than they would sell it to Americans. to the great injury of American copperworirers and the depression of the wages of this large class of mechanics. What is the use of being Americans when laws are so ""fixed"" that the protected manufacturers are enabled to charge and do charge much higher prices for their protected products to Americans than they charge for the same goods to foreigners? These facts show. Mr. Chairman. the disadvantageof beingan American consumer. There surely can be no danger that these protected manufacturers of iron and of copper would have to reduce their wages to their workmen or would be ruined in business if the tariff rates upon these articles should be reduced. when they can ship to Liverpool and sell their articles 10 or 12 per cent. lower than they can s6ll to the American consumer. Little excuse there is. Mr. Chairman. for the giving of further bounties to these same people as is proposed to do by the present bill. unless it be to pay off obligations contracted in the late campaign. I have adverted to the depression of the agricultural interests. This is distinctly admitted by the report of the majority of the Committee on Ways and Means. it was admitted again by the distinguished gentleman from Ohio. the leader of his party upon this floor. and is emphasized by the stories of distress that come to us from every quarter of the land.. General Butler. one ot the best informed men in this country. asserts that the entire burden of farm mortgages will equal or exceed the enormous sum of three and a half billions of dollars. and that this has grown up very largely. if not entirely within the past twentyfive years. The boast of the majority has been that under this system we have paid the national debt. Ah. Mr. Chairman. we have indeed paid a large portion of the national debt. but we have paid it by a system that plunged our farmers into a greater indebtedness by nearly two dollars to one. In a word. we have transferred the burdens of the national debt from the shoulders of the whole people to the protected backs of the farmers. and this we have done while maintaining a system of home markets. The fallacy and delusion of this homemarket doctrine were never more completely shown in the world. Eloquent and convincing as have been the speeches of the distinguished gentlemen upon this side of the House upon the subject of the depression of the agricultural interests. they stand mute and meaningless before the irresistible logic of the confession of the majority itself Their proposition to defend the farmer from the admitted difficulty under which he labors by a compensatory system of tariff upon the farm products is the admission of the failure of the theory of the home market and is the confession that the promises made to l4im for twentyfive years past have been a sham and a pretense. The fallacy of the system is acknowledged. the confession of its hypocrisy is full and complete. the bubble has barst. the mirage has vanished. But what is this new boon that they. purpose giving the farmer and what will it advantage him? Why. they levy taxes upon nearly all classes of agricultural products. and there were during the last year about $25.000.000 of such farm products imported. nearly onefourth of which was barley of the quality better for malt than we produce here. ""Twentyfive million dollars."" said the distinguished gentleman from Ohio in a magnificent burst of eloquence. ""saved to the farmers of tis country!"" Well. they need it badly enough. Twentyfive million dollars will pay nearly twothirds of 1 per cent. of the mortgages resting upon the farms of this country. if we accept the estimate of the distinguished exgovernor of Massachusetts. Wonderfulrelief this! Mark you. if every dollar that the consumers of this country now pay for the hitherto untaxed farm products is now kept in this country and every mill of this sum were a clear profit to the farmer (instead of possibly 10 per cent.) they would thereby have nearly money enough to pay 1 per cent. of the interest of the mortgages on their farms. Is it possible that the agriculturists of this land could ask more? Will they still be dissatisfied? Will they still question the wisdom of this system after their farms sink lower and lower in the market. and from the 50 or 60 per cent. they now have decline to 40 or 50 per cent. ? Blind and ungrateful people. have we not given you home markets and shut out the cabbages of pauper Europe from competing with your cabbages? And. although no broom corn has come into your country. have we not said that that great American staple. broom corn. shall hereafter be sacred on American soil? And have not a Republican Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled enacted that wherever the sacred folds of the starry banner floats the American cow shall be protected from the sweet milk that might be imported from Patagonia and Greenland? Oh. blind and perverse generation what more would you have? But it remained for the distinguished gentleman from Maine. a member of the Ways and Means Committee in the present House. to add the last and crowning absurdity to the claims that have been made for this system of high protection. Speaking in the House last week. he said that under this system the fleece of the American sheep had increased from an average weight of less than 2 pounds to an average weight of 6 pounds. and he cited this as one of the blessings of a hightariff system. Did it occur to the gentleman that the breeds of the sheep have improved in freetrade England. and that the average weight of fleece in that pauperized country is greater than on our protected sheep. and did not the absurdity of his position strike him when he gravely told the House that the weight of the fleece had still increased from 1884 to 1890. although the whole sheep industry had been depressed because the tax on wool was too low. The remarkable spectacle of a protected sheep growing wool of a longer and finer fiber than a sheep kept in a freetrade country has been reserved for the present day and generation. and conclusively shows how little poor old Solomon knew what he was talking about when he observed ""there is nothing new under the sun."" But. Mr. Chairman. I desire. before proceeding further in this argument. to call the attention of this House to how this new bounty system meets the wishes of the people of the great city I have the honor in part to represent. New York. Mr. Chairman. is not alone a great manufacturing city. but. as every one knows. a great commercial city. a city of consumers as well as a city of producers. Commerce. Mr. Chairman. is the very lifeblood of our city. its miles of wharves lined with the vessels of every nation on the globe (I believe there are a fewAmerican vessels left yet). bringing to our shores the wealth of every nation on the globe. and taking back the surplus of the great agricultural West. the busy traffic of our crowded streets. our vast shipments and transshipments to the Westthese are the industries upon which the two million and a half people of New York and Brooklyn largely depend. and every blow at foreign commerce is a blow at the interests of every citizen of New York. But commerce has not been considered in this bill. rather this bill is aimed to destroy commerce. The unfortunate citizen of New York who depends for his employment upon commercial activity finds himself. like poor Othello. with his occupation gone and on the other hand is confronted by higher clothing. higher household implements. higher breadstuffs. higher vegetables. higher fruits. in a word. he is compelled to pay more for all that he must consume and his opportunity for earning is .lessened and decreased. But when the friends of this measure are forced to admit that the system that has prevailed for the last twentyfive years has been ruinous to the farmer. that it has ruined our commerce. that it has taxed an entire people for the benefit ofa class. then comes the last and invariable argument. how magnificently the wealth of the country has increased ! And over and over again the music of that old song is sung. behold the increase in the wealth of the country from sixteen billions in 1860 to over sixty billions in 1888. All this has been done under a protect!ive system! Therefore it has been done because of a protective system (if this last remark is not logical it is not my fault. it is a sort of specimen brick from the logic of high protection). and therefore. to make the country still richer. let us have higher taxation. Well. it is true the wealth of the country has increased. I suppose it has quadrupled in the past thirty years. but how utterly ridiculous the theory that this increase has depended altogether upon the hightax system. Did the wealth of the country never increasebefore 1860? Has the vast increase of laborsaving machinery. multiplying by two. four. six. and even ten the product of a days labor. has the development of the vast areas ofthefertile West. the opning up of the wealthproducing mines in all parts of our country had nothing to do with this increase of wealth. to say nothing of the doubling of the population in the past thirty years ? But. Mr. Chairman. another question at once arises: The increasing wealth of a nation is not the only true test of its prosperity. but rather an increasing wealth and an equal distribution of such wealth. Isuppose there is no man upon the floor of this House who. if he could. would double the entire wealth of this nation today and provide that that increased wealth should be the sole property of say fifty thousand of its citizens. It is of no advantage to me that my neighbor is a millionaire. it rather is a disadvantage. since by so much is his influence in all things immensely increased and my influence compared to his is thereby lessened. But here comes the distinguished gentleman from Michigan. in his speech delivered also in April of 1888. and quotes from the great statistician of Massachusetts. Mr. Edward Atkinson. and says: ""The wages of the mechanics in Massachusetts were 25 per cent. more in 1885 than in 1860."" that is. that in a quarter ofa century the wages of mechanies. and I suppose he includes in it the wages of the operative as well. have increased 25 per cent. This by itself I admit would be a very gratifying showing. and he further says that the purchasing power of a dollar is at least 26 per cent. greater now than it was in 1860. and this. too. is a very pleasing fact. But bear in mind the estimate of this same distinguished gentleman. thht the aggregate wealth of the country has increased 400 per cent. in this same period of time. In a word. the aggregate capital of the country is earning 300 per cent. more than it was earning in 1860. and brain and muscles are earning 25 per cent. more. and the purchasing power of the rich mans dollar has certainly kept pace with the purchasing power of the poor mans dollar. and this. Mr. Chairman. I suppose is about a fair statement of what wealth has gained and what labor has gained under the protective system. Let us pursue a little further this discussion of the increase in wages of the American wageworker in the past thirty years. which. as I have already said. is one of the advantages claimed for the protective tariff. Why. under this pretense of benefiting the laborer the whole system is urged. and. if it did really benefit the laborer to the extent that the friends of this system claim. this system of taxation. grievous and unjust as it is. might with better patience be borne. The wages of the laborer have risen 25 per cent. in thirty years. These thirty years have been years of marvelous progress in the invention of laborsaving machinery. and the output of the American worker has increased in this space of time vastly more than 25 per cent. Ina word. if the American operative gets more than he did twentyfive years ago he produces more. and he gets more for the very simple reason that he earns more. and the protective system has about as much to do with this as the spots on the surface of the sun. There is still another and. in my judgment. more potent factor in the advance which labor has made. aid that is the workingmens organizations. It is not labor. but organized labor. that has commanded the attention and won the respect of the capitalists of this country. Every advance that labor has made. every step further in the march of civilization. every dollar added to the wages of the days toil. every minute stricken from the hours of toil. have been. not the gifts of these protected gentlemen under whose oppression the whole country groans. but the results of hardfought battles. won by organized labor against capital.* often against organized capital. To the brave and fearless men who have sacrificed time and money and position in organizing labor. in defending its interests. in claiming for the laboring man at least a small share of all the blessings of advancing civilizationto these men and to the workingmen themselves is due the credit of every victory that labor has ever won. and there nre small thanks due to the capitalist. whether individual or corporation. who has yielded only as little as he could. and that when absolutely compelled to. But. Mr. Chairman. the very fact that labor organization is necessary in this country shows the onward strides of the money power. Thirty years ago labor was fairly compensated. with little or no friction between the employer and the employed. These vast labor organizations permeating every branch of industry. stretching through the length and breadth of our land. with hll the expenses of their organi- zation. the rents of the halls in which they meet. the supportof their officers and their delegates. their printing. and all the numberless expenses incident to the forming and the maintaining of such organizations. all these are charges upon the laboring men. They are in the nature of a standing army to care for and maintain the rights and integrity of the workingmen. Labor that formerly rested in peace. secure in the thought that in this land of the free a days toil commanded a days pay now sleeps upon its arms. a vast. an organized. a disciplined. and a watchful army. seeking not undue advantages. but maintaining itself as best it can against the encroachments of the money power of this land. And here again I say. in the name of protected labor. has a system been maintained that benefits the employer and not the employed. for with the very dollars wrung from the pockets of the consumers in this land and given as a bounty to the manufacturer. the manufacturers have gone abroad and imported foreign labor in direct competition with the earners of our own land. And when a strike came. when the American workingman demanded at least some share in this river of wealth that the last thirty years have poured into the pockets of the manufacturers. then these same manufacturers. knowing that they were protected by a tariff from foreign competition. knowing that foreign manufacturers could not take from them their customers and keep them by reasonof the high duty system. waited complacently until the American workingmen were starved into submission or soon brought imported labor to take the places of the striking employs. The very fact that the law forbidding contract labor was necessary is eloquent in showing that the manufacturers have over and over again imported the cheap labor of Europe to take the places of our citizens. and I desire to call the attention of the House to the fact that the original contractlabor law. making possible this infamous contract system that was for so many years pursued. was a Republican measure. and the laws protecting American labor upon the statutebooks of all the States and largely upon the statutebooks of the United States itself are Democratic enactments. Now. ir. Chairman. while the American manufacturer is protected by these duties and it is proposed to still further increase this protection by higher taxes upon the entire people of this land. there is no protection at all for the laborer from the competition of the foreign laborer. The vast army of immigration that each year has brought to our shores has absolutely deluged the labor market. and only by the most thorough system of labor drganizatiou is it possible for labor to win a single battle. The real condition of the workingman today in this country is that he pays a higher price for everything he buys in order that the manufacturer may be enabled to pay him a higher price for his days toil. and the manufacturer in turn gives him as little as possible for that toil. Well. I do not know that I blame the &nanufacturerso much for this. He does as all men have done since the world began: he buys as cheap and sells as dear as he possibly can. Supply and demand. Mr. Chairman. and not high duty. determine the wages of the laborer. When there are a hundred men seeking one place of work. wages will be low. when there are a hundred employers seeking one man. wages will be high. This law of supply and demand is as inexorable as the law of gravity. and when we attempt to change this law by legislative enactment. all the measures this Congress can enact will be as futile as a cobweb chain stretched across the torrents of Niagara. Under this system we have made the lot of the laboring man worse. because we have given the manufacturer and capitalist the added power of added wealth with which to fight the battles with labor and obtain the labor that he needs as cheap as he can. There is still another view of this subject. My distinguished friend from West Virginia. speaking upon the Mills bill two years ago. said there never has been a permanent class of wageworkera in this country. That statement was true. Mr. Chairman. thirty years ago. under the old system. That statement had some element of truth in it ten years ago under this system. He would be blind indeed who would claim that statement is true today. In every manufacturing town. in all our great cities. upon every railroad in this great land. by the looms of every mill. beside the forge of every workshop. stand today thousands of wageworkers who are wageworkers only. who have no hope or ambition of being other than they are. who can not earn enough to educate their children. who are without the sympathy of their employers. and who have no hope of any change in their condition unless it be a change of degree and not of kind. That is. they may hope for shorter hours or better pay. but they can not and do not expect to be anything other than they are. On the other hand. there is a smaller and more favored class who. holding a large part of the wealth of the nation. employ vast numbers of workingmen. whose interests are often opposed to the interests of their employ~s. who live beyond the reach of hard times. whose children are reared in luxury. knowing nothing of the struggles of the toiling millions. and who are today. and whose children will be in the future. a permanent class of capitalists. Now. Mr. Chairman. I have no quarrel at all with wealth. many of the wealthy men of this country are among its grandest and its purest citizens. I do not contend that wealth can ever be equally distributed in any nation. There have always been the rich. there have always been the poor. and I do not suppose there ever will be an equality. I would not if I could by any law or enactment of this body take one dollar from the rich man that was r*htly his and give it to the poor. I do not believe it the province ofovernment to take from any man a part of his rightful holding. but I do contend that this system of taxation that has prevailed in this country for the past thirty years. this same system. mark you. that we now purpose to extend. has been asystem that facilitated the acquisition of wealth by those who already had capital. While I have already said that it is not the province of government to take from the rich and give to the poor. still must I contend it is not the province of government to take from the many and give to the few. There are men in this House. Mr. Chairman. who remember the conditions that prevailed in this country thirty years ago. There were few great corporations then. few men employing large numbers of other men. The poor boy who started out in the race of lifb entered the small shop or factory under the immediate eye of his employer. He mastered his trade in all its branches. his interests and the interests of his employer were identical. he sought and soon won promotion. he became in time the foreman. the superintendent. the partner or the successor in business. and he had the hope of this success constantly before him. Why. the very sons of the employer worked side by side with the employ6s. But this is all in the past. Such have been the encroachments of capital. as I have already demonstrated. that the laboring men have been compelled to organize and the interests of the employer and the employd that formerly were one are now often widely apart. The employer no longer seeks in the ranks of his employs for his trusted servants. The men who are to be superintendents of the factories go in at the office door. and not with theshophands. and if this condition of things be true after thirty years what may we expect when thirty years shall have become sixty years and the tariff become altogether prohibitive? What may we expect when the population of this country has doubled again and again. when a new generation succeeds the present generation. and the sons of the men who are but laborers are employed by the sons of the men who are now rich? When even what sympathy still exists shall have diminished and disappeared and the entire army of the manufacturing industries shall be divided between those who never toil and those who can hope for nothing but toil. what will be our condition in the very near future. when the last acre of the public domain is preempted and occupiedfor it must be borne in mind. Mr. Chairman. that during all this time the vast West has swallowed up a large portion of the army of immigration and given homes to those that the capitalists have driven from manufacturing employment because they would not give them a fair proportion of the profits had under this systemwhat will be the condition. I say. when capital has still further combined to put up the prices of the necessaries of life and corporate influences become still more vast. extending. and farreaching? I n a word whither are we drifting? What will be the condition of this country thirty years hence? Will it not closely resemble England. that England whence so many of the oppressed have come? We on this side have been accused of being English in our tendencies. and the monopolistic friends of the workingman on the other side have yelled ""English "" and ""free trade"" whenever any proposition was made to equalize conditions in this country. and this country has for thirty years. step by step. gone forward towards English conditions. a condition of permanent classes. a condition where the wealth of the country and its great capitalistic interests largely dominate and control the country. The lands of the farmer. heavily mortgaged. hopelessly so in many cases. must soon become the property of the moneylenders. and there has already begun in this country a system of tenant farming. Why. certain wealthy manufacturers have purchased and laid out a game park in the old State of New Hampshire after the English fashion. and the farms that ought to have been valuable if the theory of home market had any truth in it. the farms that -lay almost within sight of the smokestacks of the protected factories. worn out. or rather taxed out. are to be turned into a game park for these wealthy gentlemen. Indeed. this system is making us English wonderfully fast! And when the last of the public domain is taken up the change towards the conditions of the Old World will be still more rapid. Well did my distinguished friend from New Jersey say ""The public lands are the safetyvalves of the nation ."" and swift as has been the movement in the direction of the old social system of Europe. its pace will be vastly accelerated when we no longer have public lands for the settler. Another evil of giant growth has sprung up under this boasted system. De Tocqueville. writing of America in 1832. said that he never had heard in his travels in this country of a wealthy man using his wealth to be elected to any office. Shade of De Tocqueville ! Shades of the fathers of the Republic! Could they return to earth and see this protected America. this America where the manufacturer buys his seat in the legislative bodies of his State or nation. this America where the protected laborer is so poor. or rather so hopeless. and because he is hopeless so lost to selfrespect and political honor. that he sells his suffrage as a citizen almost in the public market. This shameless bribery of the suffrages of the citizens of a free country is another advance in civilization that has had its inception and its growth under the hightax system. The land indeed has grown wondrously civilized. Everybody pays a tax to be manufacturer to enable him to pay good wages to his workmen. and the workingmen have to maintain a standing army in order to get even a decent living from their protected employers. The lhrmers have grown poor in this attempt to make the nation rich. Commerce has vanished. and lie who would seek to encourage its restoration is looked on as a public enemy. and a very few people compared with the 65.000.000 of the American nation have all thebenefits gathered by the entire system. These beneficiaries these modest gentlemen. having recently purchased the election of a President and a majority of the American Congress. through their faithful servants. the representatives of the Republican party. demand still higher taxes. In the name of the laborer they oppre3s. whom they blacklist. whom they bribe. whom they have made forever a laborer. in the name of the laborer. not for themselves! dear. generous soulsfor the poor workingman. not at all for themselvesin his name they ask for still higher taxes upon the people. still greater bounties for their own pockets. And when. sir. members of this minority. representatives of the peoplemembers. I was about to say. of the great party of the peoplehave risen in their places upon this floor and demanded a hearing for the consumers and working people of this land. they have been denied the time necessary for an intelligent discussion of this measure. Accused of hasty and illconsidered legislation. the Republican leaders have sat silent. arraigned as the friends of the rich and the enemies of the poor. they have sat silent. indicted as representatives of trusts and monopolies. they have sat silent. They have voted this measure through line by line. withoo. listening to argument or heeding the voice of protest. They have announced upon this floor that they were sick of all this talk and the country was sick of it and taken refuge behind their servile majority and refused to discuss this measure. And now Isuppose the outrage is to be perpetrated. This measure is to he passed. the bargain made two years ago when the flat was fried out of the protected manufacturer is to be consummated. Noone has the courage to protest. no one the manliness to object. You of the majority are dominated by the money power of the land. their will your pleasure. their command your law. Throughout this entire session you have followed their every behest under guidance of your Speaker. who has been to your side a sort of Italian padrone who makes known the command of the boss to the laborer. But do not for a moment fancy that even in this iniquitous bill you have paid the full price of your submistion. The Republican party will be compelled to yield more and more of its independence and its principles to the selfish capitalist and the soulless corporations until at last. its very name a hissing and a reproach. it will be thrust from the seat of power by the strong hand of an aroused and indignant people. In the name of that people whose trust you have betrayed. in the name of the mortgaged farmer. impoverished and hopeless. in the name of vanished commerce. driven from our seas. in the name of the workingman. degraded and oppressed. in the name of every principle of good government. of equity. fair dealing. and of justice. I protest against the enactment of this measure. the most iniquitous taxlaw ever thrust upon a longsuffering and a burdened people.",1890-05-20,Mr. TURNER. of New York,D,6.0,CHARLES,TURNER,H,M,NY

1222913,510103441,"Mr. President. the bill now under consideration is the result of a system of progressive evil. it is the offspring of a long continued evolution in unjust taxation. the bold culmination. the climax of a series of oppressive enactments. extending through more than a quarter of a century. whereby at least onethird of the earnings of labor have been bestowed as a gratuity on the idle rich. the privileged few. while the laboring men and women of the United States have been given over by law to toil for their taskmasters two days out of every six without a farthing of profit or income to themselves. In the great old forests of the world trees are sometimes found by the traveler bearing breadfruit for his support. while others are found dripping with poison for his destruction. and each tree simply presents the growth and development of the original ingredient. whether for good or for evil. which it contains. The bill before the Senate springs from a parent stock whose life germ is vicious. whose sap and vitality are imbued with a venom fatal to liberty and equality. it springslrom the worst doctrines of a high protective tariffcarried to criminal excess. The committeetooms in this Capitol where it was conceived and brought forth were besieged by emissaries of hoary. bloated. and experienced avarice. each striving to sc. shape and fashion the forthcoming financial monster as to give it increased strength for the enrichment of special interestS. Every claw with which it was to tear the fruits of labor from the farmer and every tooth with which it was to rend and crush his substance were carefully inspected in the lobbies and found to be sound and reliable. A few days ago the Senator from Colorado [Mr. TELLERJ. in his place on this floor. cited the startling and dangerous fact that while the population of the United States will reach 65.000.000. and perhaps more. yet 100.000 people. only one out of every 650 of our entire inhabitants. own at this time onehalf the wealth ""of this. the richest country on the globe."" and he migbt with equal truth and accuracy have said that this favored Jew. the 100.00% either directly or indirectly. either by actual possession or through trusts. monopolies. comhines. colossal corporations. and ple4horic loan associations. this day exert the full and absolute control of ownership over all the wealthnot merely onehalfbut all the wealth protected by the American flag. And it is only in the impure and tainted political and moral atmosphere. generated by such a corrupt concentration of enormous wealth in the hands of the few that a financial measure like the one now pending would dare to show the hard outlines of its guilty face. much less would it expect to be treated with respect. spoken well of. and thrust as a law )nto the already darkened homes of suffering and protesting millions. Certain speciesof vegetation and certain forms of animal life grow and flourish oniy where the noxious miasma fills the air with its exhalations. and so it is that certain depraved conditions of the public service and of habitual submission to insolent oppression must be known to exist before a scheme such as this. supported by not a single just principle nor honest reason. but resting alone on lust for private. personal gain. could be brought forward and live an hour. On the high plane where our fathers dwelt. and where they built this Government. in the uplands. if I may so speak of American history. betore the money power had polluted and debauched the civil service aud the official conscience of the Government. this measure would have withered and perished in a moment. Instead of being fed and fattened on the political malaria of the present day. it would have been blighted by the scorn and horror of a pure. untainted public opinion. and disowned and cast out by upright men of all parties. Sir. if the terms in which I characterize this bill. before taking up and exposirg its details. seem of unwonted severity. I will at this point challenge t he attention of Senators and of the cotmtry to the astounding fact that of the fourteen schedules of dutiable articles which the bill contains. the only reductions made are in the schedule relating to sugar and molasses. which. in the light of the propoted bounty to sugarplanters. is no redaction at all. and in the. schedule relating to spirits. wines. and other beverages. where no reduction ought to take place. In every one of the remaining twelve schedules. embracing as they do all the essentials of human existence. the tariff taxes fbr consumers to pay havas been increased. In the minority report of the Ways and Means Committee of thellouse. written by the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. C1aISLE]. then a member of that body. the following statement is made: No reduction has been made in the amount of duties imposed under any schedule exeept that relating to sugar and molasses. In all the other thirteen schedules of dutiable goods. embracing almost every important article the people use except tea and coffee. which have been free for many year.. increases are made. and in many of them the increase is very large. It will here be seen that the bill while in the House contained no reduction of duties on spirituous liquors. but the Finance Committee of of the Senate. in order. as it would seem. to make it somewhat worse. have provided for lower taxes on imported brandy.whisky. champagne. cordials. liqueurs. arrack. absinthe. kirschwasser. ratafia. vermouth. and other spirituous beverages known to the highpriced palates of the rich and selfindulgent. while on every article absolutely necessary to the home life of the farmer. the mechanic. and the day laborer existing tariff taxes have been retained and in many most vital instances enormously in(reased. It staggers belief and exhausts all sense of forbearance towards such a system or taxation when we find from the actual figures here in the plain light of day that the revenue to be derived from imported spirits of all kinds is made lighter to consumers by the sum of $217.158 per annum. while in the schedule relating to wool and the manufactures of wool th. annual increase in the amount of revenue to be derived therefrom under the provisions of this bill is put down by the authors of the bill themselves at the terrific sum of $14.412.653. Sir. in what age are we living. and for what manner of people are we legislating? Is this a period of darkness. and are the American people not only bereft of reason to ascertain their wrongs. but also destitute of every instinct of equality and justice in their own behalf? Even the poor blind worm turns in resentment when it is trodden on. Do the authors and advocates of this most unnatural and most revolting measure expect its victims to do less? Are we living in the torrid zone where a scant measure of cotton cloth constitutes a suit of clothes. and where woolen wear is not one of the wants of life? Are we legislating far the barbarian races of interior A frica who are clothed with little else than sunshine. and to whom taxation on wearing apparel is an unknown mystery. or rather are we not here making laws for a great and stalwart people far north of the equator. where the mercury in the tube marks from zero to 4UY below. and with whom wool and the manufactures ofwool are in as universal use. and are as imperative a necessity to life. as the air they breathe? From in.ancy to old age. from the cradle to the grave. at every step of the way on lifes toilsome journey. the one incessant and inexorable want of the American people is for the manufactured productions of wool. and for that. reason. and that reason alone. this bill levies an additional blacknail of nearly $15.000.000 a year on this supreme want of men. women. and children. there being no mom escape from its payment than there is from death. There is no pretense that this increase of taxation on woolen goods is made for parposes o1 revenue. or thatitis needed in the Treasury. it is simply the doctrine of protection run mad and developed into a Chinese wall of prohibition against importation. thus leaving the American manufacturer without competition in American markets. there to fix his own prices with no one to undersell him. there to force the sale of his commodities at double their actual value on unwilling purchasers who have access to no other markets. and there to glut. cram. and gorge himself with worse than stolen millions while the farmer continues to nortgage his farm. and the wageworker continues to toil and economize in order that his wifb and children may have. if possible. one square meal a day. The mask is off at last. clear off. We are no more to be deluded with soft and skillful words in behalf of protection as an incident to revenue. nor are we any longer to listen to the sirens pathetic song in the nursery of infant industries. These infants. whose crying woes and puerile attempts to walk alone for the last hundred years have excited so much sympathy and subsidized so much eloquence. have now becone fullgrown. robust highwaymen. no longer asking protection for their weakness. but demanding the legalized privilege as a right. and without disguise to raid. loot. and plunder every precinct of honest industry in the United States. The miserable reptile in the fable that was warmed back into life from a frozen. dying condition. and at once sought to fasten its fangs in its benefactor. has many and powerful imitators and disciples in these days. Fostered and built up by the patient drudgery of the American people in sustaining the indefensible principle of protecting one interest by taxing another. the manufacturing monopolists have finally seized the mastery of the country. and tre now crushing out the prosperity and the happiness of every class except their own. A further examination of this bill. however. reveals still deeper depths of wickedness in its provisions than a mere general increase of tariff taxation. however great that increase may be. During the short ministry of the Divine Nazarene on earth it will be found that he bestowed his blessings on the poor and his maledictions on the rich.

The report was read. as follows: The Committee on War Claims. to whom was referred the bill (H. :R. 2s%) for the relief of Allard & Crozier. report as follows: This claim isfor200 barrels of flour taken from Allard & Crozier. of Paducah. Ky.. on the 6th day of September. 1861. by order of General E. A. Payne. commanding United States troops atrthat point. Generallewsham. in reply to a letter of inquiry from General A. B. Eaton. Commissary General. under date of September4.1874. says: ""Thellour. amountingto 360 barrels. and all other propertyin the depot were turned over in mypresence byorder of Geneml Payne to William G. Pinckard. lieutenant and acting assistant quartermaster. for use of the troops. The said flour belonged to Mr. Slackand to Allard & Crozier. of Paducah. Mr. Slack claimed 160 barrels and Messrs. Allard & Crozer200 barrels. I may havegiven these gentlemen receipts for the above within a day or two or so after the capture of Paducah. but at this length of time I can not be certain. The flour was not paid for. but was issued by Lieutenant Pinekard to the troops. Ifthe flour sqtaken by us at that time has not been paid for by your department. I would consider a claim at fair rates per barrel as eminently just and proper. for the said flour was used for the Army."" The loyalty ofclaimants at the date of the taking of the flour and ever since is clearly established beyond controversy. Claimants filed their claim in the office of the Commissary General. and that officer rejected the claim for the reason that he was not satisfied as to the loyaty of the claimants. The officer who took the flour vouches for the loyalty of the claimants. The collector of internal revenue at Paducah. Ky.. under date of April 23. 1873. in a letter to the Commissary General. says that the claimants were loyal during the war. The flour was worth at the time It -was taken $7.50 per barrel. amounting to $1.500. Your committee. in view of the foregoing statement of facts. report back the bill and recommend its passage.

In 1882 a ""rider"" was placed on the naval appropriation bill. providing that only so many ofthe graduates of the Naval Academy should enter theserviceas there might bevacancies for. that the others should go back into civil life. There has been a good deal of controversy about that question. but ithas been held by numerous boards of visitors. and by others who have investigated the subject. that no harm is done by that provision of law to these young men. who get an excellent education at the expense of the Government.. especially in all the mechanical scienceselectricity. mechanical engineering. etc.. and are then sent out to cam their living. In favor of such a provision itmay be said that in case of war these young men. scattered throughout the country in the civil walks of life. can be brought forward to take the command of vessels or of men. Now. I have never been able to see why the whole class graduating at West Point should he mustered into the military service until under the present system our Army has become very topheavy. I thinkno inj ustice would be done at all to theose young men. if only those for whom there is actual occupation should enter the Army and the others be sent back into civil life in various parts of the country. where they would be subject to the call of the Government in caseof war. I have not before me the Army Register. but I have no doubt that the dis. proportion between the number of men and the number of officers in our Army is very great. and as our Army may be for some time out of work. its ""occupation gone"" like that of Othello. except so far as it may be employed in hunting the few remaining Sioux Indians. this force will either have to be mobilized and put in large bodies in our cities. or the talents of which gentlemen have spoken will have to be utilized in the civil walks of life. I think the solution of the problem with which the gentleman has been wrestling so admirably during the last forty minutes would be that so many of these young men as we can not find immediate employment for in the Army should bc sent back into civil life.

1430620,520078450,"Mr. President. we have had some examples of the repetition of speeches in the silver debate druing the present session with little recognizable difference of argument or language. and therefore. not assuming that the subject was wholly exhausted by any previous remarks of mine. and that they only need to be repeated a little louder. I shall not dull the ears of the Senate with loudness. and with as little as possible of what Shakspeare called "" damnable iteration."" The freecoinage resolution which opened this debate was evidently pushed by the distinguished Senator from Alabama with some comic hopefulness that the Senatorial Democratic candidates for the Piesidency would remain in the Senate to have their iotes counted. and not seek by flight outside into the boonproof smoking room to escape from all harm. But the skilled marksman from Alabama must have been sadly disappointed. as I was. that he did not wing a single Presidential bird. and he was apparently not unwilling that the brave Senator from Nevada. nothing loath."" should jump on board of the rudderless freecoinage craft as the pilot to steer it on its perilous voyage. Surely no pilot from any Northern State east of the Mississippi could be found with a greater contempt of danger. The accidental absence of Republican Senators and the failure of prominent Democratic members to respond at the roll call brought the question before us. but no friend of sound money on a real and just basis for the actual use of both gold and silver need be apprehensive about the most extended discussion nor about the final result. Evidently the freecoinage prescription that has been prepared in Nevada for our monetary ills appears to beTake the hair. it is well written. Of the dog by which youre bitten. It will be seen that it is proposed to cure the plague of a great redundance of American silver on the homceopathic theory of similia similibus curantur. not. however. by the orthodox diluted infinitesimal dose. but by a larger heroic dose. to include not only all of our own silver product. but also that of the world at large. When I am told by men. sane upon all other subjects. that the United States alone could safely assume. notwithstanding its present impaired digestive organs. the risk of unlimited silver coinage of the bullion of all mankind. I am forced to admit. as much as I am wont to admire glittering FourthofJuly jaunty jingoism. that I believe the United States would suffer an inglorious surfeit. and it would turn out that we had been only used. like the cat in the fable. to pull the chestnuts out of the fire merely to save the paws of monkeys abroad from being burned. while depreciated silver here would still be depreciated silver. It has been heretofore supposed that there was one point upon which all Senators were agreed. and that was as to the expendiency and necessity of "" an international bimetallic agreement."" I confess that was and is my strongest hope of deliverance from monometallism. A joint resolution was introduced by the learned Senator from Colorado early in January last. and after reference to the Finance Committee. was promptly and unanimously reported with satisfactory amendment. The disclosure recently made in the Senate by the conspicuous leader of freesilver coinage from Nevada is. that an "" international bimetallic agreement"" is no longer to be sought after. or even tolerated. but to be dismissed with contumely. Even the author of the joint resolution can no longer be reckoned among its supporters. The rabbis of the recent prosilver convention. which assembled here to boom free coinage and dictate what should and what should not be done. issued their edict against any international attempt at an agreement. as well as against any change of the present ratio. by which silver should be maintained on a parity with gold. They do not want it. If any proof were wanting before. this conclusively shows that the design is to thrust upon our country at once. if possible. the silver standard of all legaltender money. There never has been a time more auspicious for the solution of the silver problem than the present. All the leading European nations have accepted our invitation for an international monetary conference. With a President beyond all question earnestly in favor of bimetallism. we have an ample guaranty that persons would be selected on our part to conduct the internationaagreement with efficiency and with fidelity to every interest of the country. India. the most populous and profitable outlying possession of Great Britain. with its extensive industrial interests.. disastrously handicapped by the free coinage of silver. sells its products without any augmentation of price for depreciated silver. and collects all of its revenue in silver. which has to be used at the rate of $3 to pay $2 of its enormous indebtedness 1o England. India is therefore now in precisely the same helpless and pitiful predicament in which the United States would be found whenever it attempts alone to relieve the universal depreciation of silver by free coinagea job that no other enlightened nation could be induced to assume the risk. England. hitherto standing aloof from bimetallism. is now compelled to listen to the supplicants of India. and no longer withhold favor to all international agreements. Other nations of Europe will follow her example. For the first time in twenty years an agreement in favor of bimetallism no longer appears impossible. And yet if free coinage of silver were to be established here precedent to any international agreement. there is not a single nation in Europe that would give the subject further consideration. They would all gladly leave to us and to India the possession of the great white elephant. When the partisans of free coinage of silver talk about bimetal5318 lism. they mean goodbye to all but silver. All else must get out of the way. No provision is ever suggested in behalf of an increase or retention of gold. butwe are asked to believe that when the Government purchases silver at the coining price the owners ask for it. and declare that the public shall take it at that price. that then its value will miraculously mount up to a parity with gold. Mr. President. that declaration would not go unchallenged by the freshman class of a womans village school in Wayback. The contention that we can add 50 per cent to .the value of silver throughout the world by the free coinage of silver dollars containing 3711 grains of pure silver. to the full extent of whatever silver bullion may be attracted to the United States mints. or be presented from all quarters of the world. to be coined and held forever imprisoned in the tombs of the United States Treasury. and there to sustain a legaltender paper circulation with the full value of any other dollar. is a feat of hardly less extravagance than would be a patent project to warm the moon by setting fire to a woodpile on Pikes Peak. Suppose for a moment that the learned and distinguished Senators from Colorado and Nevada. the Ulysses and Ajax of the silver hosts. working with all of the unflagging zeal of those who once burnt heretics at the stake in behalf of the rich silver combination. should be crowned with victory. but ultimately find that free coinage failed to fulfill their astonishing predictions. and that silver. instead of jumping up in value. remained at its present unsatisfactory price. or even drooped and dropped. as I sincerely believe it would. to a lower figure. They would then have t~meet the rebound of the bitter disappointment of their too credulous followers. now visibly growing less. and showing some unwillingness to stand up in the House of Representatives to be counted. Like an enthused citizen on our northern border in the war of 1812. who offered to take all the Canadas on the condition that the General Government should furnish him with one regiment of soldiers. and if he then failed he would throw in his time. the enthused silver leaders. in the case of the failure of silver to rise in value from the present actual ratio of 23 to the old standard ratio of 16 to 1 of gold. could do no more than to throw in their time. It is also persistently claimed that the deterioration in the value of silver throughout the wide world has been caused solely by our Government in purchasing it as a commodity at its market value. and now. as a potent remedy. it is rather queerly proposed that the Government shall make a standing and irrevocable offer. fixed by law. to accept at a fixed price all the silver which the owners or producers may bring to our mints. and that the price shall be $1 for 371f grains of silver. or 50 per cent above the market price. The Government now purchases silver. and pays for it all that it is worth. but the silver corporations insist that it shall be purchased in wholly unlimited amounts. and at a price fixed by law 50 per cent above what any other purchaser would offer. The Government is also to coin it without toll or seigniorage. while giving to silver corporations a bonus or subsidy of unparalelled magnitude. By free coinage of silver we should purchase it of all silver owners and producers by a standing offer of 100 cents for the amount we now purchase for 67 cents. and. if we were to make the offer of $1 for the amount of bullion required for a silver dollar. we should be likely to hear less about silver being treated as a commodity. for it is not merely more silver dollars that are so much wanted. as an obligation of the Government to pay a higher price for silverobullion. or that the dollar which they receive in payment shall pass as a Government promise of a dollar. and not as a representative of a limited amount of silver. But the commodity complaint has no real foundation at the present time. It is only when gold or silver coins fall below or rise above par that either becomes a commodity and no longer money. That calamity has not yetbefallen our country. Where the gold standard alone prevails. as in England. silver is below par and a commodity. In South America. and wherever the silver standard alone prevails. gold commands a premium. and is a commodity. and no longer money. In India silver is the standard coin. and gold commands a high premium. and is nothing but merchandise. or a commodity. but India sells its wheat and cotton for debased silver with no advancement of prices and with no increase of the wages of labor. Its wheat was worth three silver rupees per quintal in 1872. and no more fourteen years afterwards. Silver rupees were formerly worth 48 cents. and now are worth less than 32 cents. Of course it very largely reduced the price of English homegrown wheat. silver coinage and its paper representatives are all at par. and not commodities. but free coinage would make gold no longer money. and our silver friends appear to be determined to make it a commodity. Never in all our history has loanable money been cheaper. or obtainable by worthy borrowers on more advantageous terms than today. Some economists have doubted whether or not the facility offered to the contraction of debts was altogether beneficial. as it encouraged too often more than doubtful enterprises. and enticed many men to ruin. Within afew years the general rates of interest have been reduced nearly onehalf. This has recently caused a wider attention to investments in land as yielding a higher income. and perhaps more safe than any to be derived from loans or stock in corporations. Certainly land in many parts of the country appears to be advancing in price. The stock of money at all the great money centers of the world was never greater and never offered at lower rates of interest to borrowers. The Bank of France has reduced its rate to 21 per cent. and the open market rate. if correctly reported. in Paris is only 1 per cent. The Bank of England has made no recent change of its rate. but discounts in the open market have been as low as threefourths of 1 per cent. and bankers balances are obtainable at onefourth to onehalf per cent. At many other places in Europe rates of interest are unprecedentedly depressed. and in New York the rate is unusually low on time. and barely 1 per cent on call. The complaint about the dearness of money is manifestly unfounded. except in the imaginations of thickandthin partisans of cheap silver. It would seem that the business of the country would not be increased by increasing the plethora of money. especially of depreciated money. that would require three dollars to cover the present power of two. and that borrowers for legitimate purposes never had less to complain of as to the dearness or scarcity of money. In States heavily laden with debt there may be some persons who have been convinced that the advantage to be gained by the State would justify its payment in coin of less value than the standard at the date of its contraction. There may be also those who owe personal debts. contracted in like manner. who intend to be honest. who would not play fals3. but who would willingly. wrongfully win. and hope this will be possible. not by their action alone. but through the action of the General Government by the issue of a depreciated and cheaper coin for the payment of such debts. But these States and these debtors would be most unlikely to pay off all their indebtedness immediately after a silver era had been inaugurated. It would require much more of cheap money to cover the cost of any new enterprise or for the ordinary cost of living. and most debts might have to be renewed. Is it not likely that general credit would to a large extent suffer a collapse from any repudiating subterfuge. and that future borrowings and renewals would be hedged about with expensive conditions? Hard times. it is to be feared. would not wholly cease. Itmust. also be added that wherever the single standard of silver prevails there the very lowest standard of wages universally prevails for all wageearners. and there the products of all labor command the lowest price. The payment of debts in any country where silver is the dominant currency is a slow and wearisome task. In Mexico. with the silver standard. peonage long prevailed. by which debtors were held in servitude until their debts were paid. By the law of 1890 the amount of silver which must be purchased is constantly increasing our paper currency at the annual rate of between seventy and seventyfive million dollars. With more money in circulation than ever before. the silver orators stretch their consciences to make the American people unhappy. by persuading them that there is an alarming deficiency. They demand a greater abundance of what they call ""cheap money."" Apparently a 67cent silver dollar is not cheap enough. and they put forth the lofty demand for an increase of our circulation from twentyfour to fifty dollars per capita. to be wholly propped up on silver. in order. to make assurance doubly sure by enormous inflation. that the silver dollar shall become still cheaper. If it can not be made to appear that there is a deficiency of money in circulation. Othellos occupation would be gone. and the lavish expenditure by the chief of the silver bureau in Washington might be economically and hopelessly wound up. The delectable idea is sought to be propagated that"" the more plenty money is. the better chane of every man to make a grab."" The United States Government. it is proposed. shall make up and contribute a freecoinage grabbag. and all of the silverowners. taking precedence of those who may be destitute of the white metal. are then to plunge in up to their armpits to make their grab. The distinguished Senator from Kansas fMr. PEFFER] holds that Congress can coin moneycoin itout of cowry shells. tobacco. skins of animals. paper. or anything else. as constitutionally as out of metallic gold or silver. and that the essential matter is that Congress shall regulate the value of such coinage and put on the Government stamp. This is in accordance with ""the law and the prophets ""of the silver disciples. But is it not sad to think that these ancient and wholly obsolete financial devices should be cited in the American Senate to justify the full and unlimited use of silver as money when stamped by the Government. however small its value may be. and then to further claim it as a necessity of advanced civilization? We might as well go ages backward. and pin our faith to witchcraft. or to the touch of the king for the cure of disease. as to rely on such examples to show that any modern enlightened nations can wisely and safely coin money out of anything though destitute of all intrinsic value. ""The awful face of some monarch"" stamped on coins has ceased to confer value beyond that of the metal contained therein. Far less will grotesque examples of a long time ago serve to interpret the coinage provisions of the Constitution of the United States. Our late experience with greenbacks from 1862 to 1878. in spite of the magical stamp of the Government. shows they were all the time below par. and that experience ignominiously crushed the doctrine of fiat money forever. The bane of all commerce. as well as of all domestic business. Is an unsound. vacillating. and depreciated currency. The unsoundness of the transferable mortgage bonds authorized to be issued with the guaranty of the Argentine Republic was the primary cause of the failure of the great banking house of the Barings in London. which proved to be a financial thunderbolt ""heard round the world."" And just now comes another big crash in London of the New Oriental Bank failure for $36.000.000. due to the depreciation of silver and the increasing distrust of investments in silver countries and the withdrawal of capital therefrom. That distrust. I regret to say. has already reached our shores. The large issue of assignats by France from 1789 to 1793 were made a legal tender. bore 41 per cent interest. for the redemption of which the church and crown lands were pledged. The public debt rapidly increased. Trade and production nearly ceased. Public functionaries could no longer live on their salaries. and onethird of the French army deserted. A silver franc got to be worth six in assignats. Shopkeepers refused them for prime necessit!es. and their shops were plundered in general riots. The convention decreed six years imprisonment to any person who should sell assignats at less than their nominal value. or make any difference in price. whether paid in paper or specie. and death was decreed against all who kept back from public sale articles of first necessity. At length a thousand francs of this currency became worth less than a single franc. and then the Government decreed that ""anyone might make bargains in any currency he pleased."" This displays how powerless all governments are to create money without fall intrinsic value in the money itself. If the dollar of free coinage should fail to be current at its nominal value. is it too much to expect that we have no Don Quixotes to propose penalties of imprisonment. and perhaps of death. to any person who should part with a silver dollar for less than its nominal valve? At any rate. such heretics could not escape the awful penalty of being denounced as ""gold bugs."" Some silver partisans insist that the free coinage of silver. when made a legal tender by the fiat of the Government. would bring it to a parity with gold on the old ratio. and declare there is no proof to the contrary. They well know that not for twenty y ears. not since the sudden and growing depreciation of silver. as any nation. enlightened or unenlightened. been so foolhardy as to attempt the rash experiment. and yet they appear to insist that the United States shall alone accept it without trial. take the leap in the dark. and cut off all chance of retreat. If. however. the fiat of the Government should exhibit magical power to give a 67cent silver dollar by coining it and making it a legal tender as much curernt value year after year as a hundredcent dollar. how long would it be before some Greenback party. or before the honorable Senator from Kansas . in behalf of the Farmers Alliance. would be pushing some measure to drive all silver out the field. by declaring with irresistible logic. that if the fiat of the Government saves onethird of the cost of money by the use of silver. why not save it all by the use of paper? The silver men will find in the belly of their argument a halfgrown. lusty Greenback party. that it will not be possible to underbid. It is difficult. I know. for any of us to escape from the influence of our local surroundings. Their memories are ever vigorous. I am firmly of the opinion that maple sugar made in the spring of the year is as much entitled to a bounty as sugar made in the autumn by those who raise cane and cornstalks. I live in aState where the maple grows ""fit to be the mast of some great admiral."" but I find now and then one. residing where the magnolia and tulip trees are most prolific. so obtuse as to ay that lam mistaken abouttree sugar. certainly about ""tree molasses."" If the greatsilver mines of Nevada. Colorado. and Montana hadbeen located and developed in Europe or in Asia. instead of the United States. can anyone suppose thatfree coinage would have inspired eloquence in Colorado. much less in Kansas. and loom up here ""as a subject that touches every human being in civilized society? Is it not probable that all portions of the American people would have contemplated the fact without nervous prostration and have felt that their prosperity would suffer therefrom no decadence? The rhetorical idea that the free coinage of silver would touch and be a benediction to every human being in civilized society was obviously evolved from prominent iocal surroundings. Surely all of the socalled silver States expect to receive for their silver under the terms of the freecoinage bill. as offered by the Senator from Nevada. legaltender Treasury notes of exactly the same description as those now paid to them for silver bullion. With this they seem contented. All of these States are alsonow supplied with and have had. and now have. the first grip of a legaltender increase of money to the extent of over $4.000.000 every month. or about $50.000.000 per year. It is incredible that they can experience any insufficiency of money in local circulation. Why should they not also be contented with this? Why should they go in quest for grief? Their pathos and tears on account of a lack of money in circulation would come with a better grace from quarters not already so prodigally supplied. That a permanent monopoly of silver would prove to be a dangerous and most unprofitable measure for our country is so palpable from a business mans point of view. it seems strange that it should be boomed or even tolerated by shrewd silver corporations. The market here is already overfed. greatly needing relief by some demand abroad. and an unfettered future inflow of the metal here must necessarily further cheapen its value. A monopoly of silver by the United States would also emancipate all European nations from any fraternity with or bondage to silver. and leave them with the uncontested mastery of gold. the masters in war if there is any validity in the current European idea that a country which can pay for war supplies in gold will prevail against any power which lacks such resources. Certainly no nation destitute of the use of gold as money has ever established large and diversified home industries or foreign commerce of any considerable importance. With a permanent monoply of silver once established here the producers of silver would find the truth of Scripture that ""Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein."" and that a cheap dollar made for others would be no more in the end than a cheap dollar for themselves. with no purchasing power or exchangeable value above an equal weight of silver bullion. Should they ever get the country to reel into the bottomless pit of free coinage silverproducers could not help us out nor escape from falling in themselves. Silver mines might then prove to be a drug. not only to the public. but to the owners also. The owners might be in the condition of the gentleman who was a little crazed. but not with silver. while walking in the evening with a boon companion close to one side of the old canal as it was in the south part of Washington City in 1855. when the tide was out and the mud deep. his companion blundered off the path and went like a driven pile into the mud up to his hips and called lustily upon his associate to help him out. but was answered. ""I cant exactly do that. but I will jump in along with you."" The slvermine owners. now a little dazed. may get a tumble into the mud with none left behind to help them out. and such of their cranky leaders as have been constrained by "" foreknowledge absolute "" to have all debts due to them made payable in gold can not be relied upon to have the knightly courtesy to jump in along with them. The silver combination point to the fact that the gold in the Treasury is disappearing. and. as a remedy. offer silver in unlimited abundance to fill the void. This serious proposal. destitute of all purpose to retain even the gold we now have. has directly promoted the disappearance of gold. and. if adopted. could not fail to expel it as money from the country. although the annual production of gold in the United States exceeds that of any other country. This may be denied by ultra silver partisans. as they pretend with a dontcareanyhow shrug that free coinage would restore the lost value of silver. but it would be an impeachment of their intelligence to assume that they have implicit faith in the oretension. Business men. having abundant but unadvertised knowledge and to whom a sound and stable currency is vitally important. have not the slightest faith in the pretense. and declare that an unlimited increase of silver would not only cause the expulsion of gold. but would at once effect a further depreciation of silver. The attempt made here to lift and build up the value of silver by free coinage. and that by the United States alone. excites the amazement if not the derision of all Europe. Their experienced political and financial sages regard even our silver legislation of 1890 as bringing us to the perilous edge of a separation between our gold and silver currency. and it must be admitted that the policy of issuing millions of paper currency represented only by purchases of depreciated and nonusable silver. with the more reckless agitation of free coinage. has reduced the proportion of gold to notes over onehalf in less than two years. What. then. would be the effect if we were to offer to receive all the silver of American producers as well as all the idle and unemployed surplus of the rest of mankind for free and unlimited coinage at 50 per cent above its real value? The silver would all come to stay. and with no tracks visible of the return of any fraction of our lost gold. But it is claimed that no silver from abroad can or will be broughthere. Whynot? The totalforeign annual production in 1891 was $110.183.100. or more than onethird larger than that of the United States. which was $75.416.500. with the output daily increasing. and all Europe is sturdily refusing to increase its coinage and is curtailing its use. They will buy it as a commodity to the extent of whatever may be wanted for the arts. and all beyond that. should free coinage ever prevail here. would be brought here tobe sold as a commodity or to be coined into silver dollars. but not to be carried back where they would be worth less than silver bullion. What will hinder its coming from countries where the doors are slammed against its ingress. when itis here passionately courted and invited with wideopen doors? What would hinder the hundreds of millions of the stale silver. no longer in actual circulation. which Europe seems eager to be rid of. from coming here to claim all the privileges that may be accorded to the American output of silver already indigestible. and so excessive as to seriously embarrass our great Republic? Obviously by no possibility would any gain accrue from a silver standard to the price of cotton. whether sold for gold or silver. and it might involve a serious loss. Cotton is now paid for on a gold standard. and a change to greatly depreciated silver could hardly fail to give some substantial advantages to buyers of cotton in the American market. It would have to compete with the cotton of India. Egypt. and other countries. The very excess of the American product must make it an uncrowned king in European markets. It may be true that some freetrade partisans. especially in the cotton States. would rejoice to see the standard money of our country depreciated. at least to the amount of the protective duties. by giving foreigners the right to pay in silver all duties on their merchandise brought to our market. but they forget that the great prosperity their leading States have enjoyed since the war of the rebellion has been entirely due to a protective tariff. which has decorated their States with flourishing manufactures. with many millions of capital. and created more profitable employment to labor than would have been derived other wise from an increase of cotton planting. The splendor of these achievements. and the utilizing by diversifying the labor of large numbers of men and women. would be extinguished by the sudden removal of all the protection which prompted and cheered the birth of these infant establishments. Is it not improbable that our Southern brethren would wholly escape the drawback of perils which might arise in enforcing a cheaper standard of money upon the laborers of the South? If a silver standard should be reached by free coinage. as merchants. bankers. and chambers of commerce believe it would be. there are few laborers. North or South. who would not quickly discover the shortage in the purchasing power of silver. Strikes would be almost inevitable. and should they occur and spread from plantation to plantation they might prove formidable if not disastrous. The latitudinarian proposition to open the United States mints to all the silver that may be offered at the price of $1 for 3711 grains. when a dollar should purchase in any market 554 grains. with the same sense of security for the public welfare that might have prevailed fifty years ago. or prior to silver depreciation. is now impossible. on account of the unforeseen and universal declension in the value of silver. arising from its recent boundless increased production. This pivotal fact is not proclaimed even in whispers by the happygolucky silver orators. but it is decisive proof of the reckless character of the proposition. There is no remedy for large and persistent overproduction save that of a largely increased consumption. and that. unfortunately. is nowhere yet in sight. If there are any prosilver men who would not favor a 33 per cent horizontal reduction of the tariff. whether because it would subject the country to a loss of revenue or a loss of protection. they will decline to force upon the United States alone the rash measure of free coinage of silver. If there are among our people many who still retain confidence in Henry Cernuschi. the eminent French leader of bimetallism. they will putfaith in his recent words. that"" it can be established only through the accord of the great metallic powers."" If we have here those who prize and reverence the profound wisdom of Hamilton and Jefferson in monitary affairs. they will not favor any policy which seriously threatens to harm all our business relations with leading commercial nations and offers to the farmer and laborer only depreciated money.",1892-06-16,Mr. MORRILL,,, ,MORRILL,S,M,

1511849,530005183,"Mr. Speaker. AND GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I am conscious.of .the fact that it will appear presumptuous on my part to occupy the attention of a body containing so many older and abler men. and my only apology for claiming your attention is the fact that I represent a peopleas much entitled to be heard upon this floor as those of any other district in our common country. and the question now before this House is of such farreaching and overshadowing importance to them that Ifeel that I should be recreant to the trust confided in me should I remain silent. My only regret is that I am not better equipped for the discharge of that great -responsibility. It is the first time in the history of our country that the Congress of the United States has been called together in extraordinary session to pass upon a demurrer filed by the Executive branch against the acts of a former Executive and Congress. It is a wellestablished rule of practice that a demurrer leveled at the answer or pleading of a defendant may be carried over to the original complaint or initiatory pleading. I therefore propose. Mr. Speaker. to insist upon applying this demurrer to the socalled Sherman silverpurchasing act. to the act of 1873 demonetizing silver. which was the primary pleading in this casethe provoking cause of the Sherman law. The wrong does not begin. sir. with the Sherman law. but began with the act of 1873. which stopped the coinage of. and consequently debased silver. A skillful patient in treating a patient seeks for the primal cause of his disease. and. in eradicating that. cures the patient. Therefore. being called together to prescribe for this dreadful Sherman act. let us like good physicians dispose of the whole question by restoring silver to the place it occupied in this Government prior to the 14th day of February. 1873. The gentleman from Indiana . on the first day of the debate upon this question. made an able appeal to thisHouse for a mere surface treatment of our financial trouble. asking us to -ignore for the time being the root of the evil. His plan would. give us no substantial relief. and would leave us. in my judgment. in a worse condition than we are today. Itrust. therefore. that we shall not subject ourselves to the criticism of having shirked our whole duty. No. sir. the mere repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman law. which is all that is contained in the bill now before us for consideration. will not meet the expectations or the demands of the American people. We should. here and now. either adopt a paper standard or firmly and positively reestablish bimetallism by giving silver her old place under our Constitution and laws. equal with gold at 16 to 1. The people whom I represent in the Third: Kansas district are farmers and miners. and those whose interests are directly dependent upon the success of those two industrial classes. and they know that they want more money. that they must have more money or lose all the property they now possess. together with all hope of future success. While they do not believe that the free coinage of silver will give them the immediate relief which is now needed. they believe that it will gradually. but certainly. give them more money and better prices. that the unconditional repeal of the silverpurchasing clause of the Sherman act will decrease the volume of the currency by reason of the holders of the coin certificates issued under that act taking them to the Treasury and demanding and receiving gold for them. and result in their ultimate retirementfrom circulation and the checking of the further issue of such notes. Give us free coinage of silver and the silver miners will at once resume work. and as fast as bullion is taken out it will be taken to the miat by the miners. coined for them. put in circulation by them in the purchase of food and clothing and in supplying their general demands. thereby rapidly increasing the volume of currency in the country. stimulating labor and prices everywhere. giving employment to the idle and unemployed. and bringing back to the country the prosperous times of 1873. We are told by the goldstardard advocates that it is not more money that we need. but more confidence. I hope they will ermit me to say to them. without any intention on my part to e humorous. that if they will give us their money we will give them our confidence. We have been confiding in them for twenty years and have constantly grown poorer. and the prices of our labor and our products have steadily gone down. with a spasmodic exception here and there. Confidence without money has deprived tens of thousands of people of their homes. of their property. and of their employment. The gold advocates have maligned and slandered our people through ignorance or malice. the result being the same to us. and charged us with dishonesty in not paying our debts. the interest and principal of mortgages held by them. thoughtlessly aEsuming that our people were giving up their homes and all they had of this worlds goods as a mere pastime. or for the simple enjoyment of hearing the complaints of the mortgage holders. No people onearth are more intelligent. industrious. or honest. as a whole. than the people of Kansas. and all this talk and newspaper twaddle about the people of Kansas suddenly becoming lawbreakers. anarchists. and criminals is the outgrowth of mendacity and want of information. Can any man possessed of reasonable decency expect an intelligent farmer to remain docile with wheat selling at 35 cents. oats at 13 cents per bushel. cattle and horses at less than onehalf that which they sold for in 1873. and all other products at about the same ratioall at less than thecost of prdduction. with here and there a nominal exceptionwith land constantly falling in price. while bonds. mortgages. interest. and taxes retain all their elephantine proportions ? Will you be kind enough. my goldstandard friends. to tell me how. under such conditions. our people can pay their debts (the securities held by you). their taxes. educate their children. and provide their families with the comforts of life? No. sirs. they are losing their homes. shortening the terms of their schools. buying fewer manufactured articles. and buying less and less of the necessities of life. not because they want to do so. but because they must. There is not a supporter of the single standard in the United States. or all Europe. that would suffer as patiently the injustice that has been done them as the people of Kansas. and of the West. and of the South. Instead of being malignedand reviled. as they have been. they should receive applause for their moderation. But. sirs. this condition can not continue much longer. We must have relief. and that speedily. or the mutterings that you have heard from the West and the South will break forth so loud that they can be heard not only in Wall street but at Buzzards By. Men recklessly tell us that we are extravagant. and yet these same men would sneer at the cheap clothing and coarse fare of our Western and Southern farmers and laborers. and of their wives and childrenand their sensibilities would be terribly shocked if they were compelled to so dress and live. Our farmers wives. many of them intelligent and well qualified to grace any station in life. are compelled not only to do their own household work and care for their children. but also to go into the field and aid their husbands in farm work. or in taking care of the stock. and a great majority of them are wholly debarred from the time or opportunity to read and cultivate their minds. or otherwise enjoy the amenities of social life. In the senseless abuse of 6ur people their traducers frequently say that they do not work enough. and then. when driven from that assertion. they say that our want of good prices is brought about wholly by overproduction. In other words. we work too little and produce too much. What a masterpiece of logic! These charges are untrue and wholly unjust. The whole truth of the matter is that there is not money enough in the country to give profitable employment to our people and enable us to pay our debts and live. Those who growl about our people in the West failing to meet their expectations remind me of a circumstance that occurred when I was in Montana some years ago. Some highwaymen or ""road agents."" as they were called there. held up a miner at the outskirts of Virginia City. and on examining his pockets they found only $5. which they relieved him of. and then kicked him soundly because he had no more. I do not expact paid newspapers to stop abusing Kansas and the people of the West. although every word I have uttered can easily be verified by any honest investigator. If they told the truth about us. like Othello. "" they would lose their occupation."" and yet. strange to say. nearly every one of these maligners of our Western people are advocates of a gold standard. and doing all they can to take away from us more than half of the money which we now have. Every step we take widens the space between the holders of gold and goldbearing securities and those who must pay. We must pay allour debts finally with labor and its products. Silver and farm products are all that America can rely upon. The only leverage we have left us to prevent our creditors from absorbing our property is silver. and that is why they are so clamorous against it. Will some supporter of the gold theory please tell us how we are to get the gold of Europe unless we increase our trade with her and have something to buy her gold with? Do they suppose. or do they expect the people to believe. that gold will flow to this country simply because we favor it? Do they regard gold as a sensate being or a cupid to be won by smiles? Shylock wanted his pound of flesh. but the gold advocates want three pounds where their bonds call for but one. as $t will now purchase three times as much of the products of the farm and mines as a dollar would at the time our debts were contracted. The holders of the securities say that it is not our fault. and blandly reply that we want our contracts fulfilled to the letter. and we say. ""grant it."" but while you demand the fulfillment of our contract. we demand that you accept without complaint the kind of money we contracted to pay you. The foundation of all wealth. of all business. and of every industry in this country is farming and mining. Consequently. when we get back to the base. the farmers and miners must pay all debts andall interest. and a burden of any kind castupon this nation or upon any of its people ultimately reaches the farmers and miners. and they are the greatest sufferers. The American silver mines are now producing $75.000.000 coin value of silver. Close the silver mines (and that is what a gold standard means). and the farmers and miners must not only make up that $75.000.000 lost to us. but must supply the 225.000 mincrs and those dependent upon them with the necessities of life. and have their farm products further depreciated by the loss of the silver. and the further increase of farm products put upon a falling market. should these miners go into the farming business. as they are advised to do by some of the gold advocates. On the other hand. the miner would be compelled to engage in a business of which he knows nothing. his wages would be decreased by more than onehalf. and discontent and crime would have thrifty growth among them. In the face of all this. where is the boasted protection to American labor? Abandoned by the men who so eloquently advocated it a few years ago. while confidence on the part of the workingmen in their sincerity. has vanished like mist before the morning sun. They say truthfully that your talk about protecting the American laborer was simply for the purpose of misleading him and thereby catching his vote. and I warn you that this bait will not catch him again. In the language of LincolnYou can fool all of the people some of the time. and some of the people all the time. but you can not fool all the people all the time. I may be oldfashioned and out of date. but I believe that under the Constitution and laws of this country the rights of the poorest farmer and most destitute minor are just as sacred and entitled to just as much consideration as the rights of the men who manipulate ""Wall street."" corner our money. and declare a panic at their sweet will.",1893-08-19,Mr. HUDSON,P,3.0,THOMAS,HUDSON,H,M,KS

True. you may say that the times and conditions have Sea of Galilee. changed. hence your change. but in the face of conditions as they While Secretary of the Treasury. during the time of a great demand on the Treasury for gold coin redemption. Mr. Manning. we are told. went to the city of New York. and calling the gold raiders together. said to them: - Gentlemen. the Treasury is willing to furnish gold for any legitimate demand. but if you attempt to draw upon the Treasury gold after today. as you are now doing. for hoarding or speculation. I shall adopt an effective remedy for the protection of the Governments reserve. We have a cash balance of $150.000 000. and not one of you doubts for a moment the purpose and ability of the Government to maintain specie payments. But if you continue to withdraw gold I shall at once order that you be paid 10 per cent in silver coin the first day. the second day you will be paid 20 per cent in silver. the third day. 30 per cent. and so on till onehalf will be paid you in silver. "" But."" exclaimed the astonished bankers. ""this is in violation of the implied obligation that the Government will pay gold."" ""Make no mistake about that."" replied Mr. Manning. ""The law says coin. and the Treasury will exercise its undoubted prerogative."" That ended the gold raiding. The Government won its point just as soon as the Secretary of the Treasury showed that he had a backbone. And it would win its point in the same way today. Mannings way was Jacksons way. when that great Democrat said. ""I take the responsibility."" and ordered the removal of the deposits from the United States Bank. telling the banking ring that if they wanted a panic they were at liberty to proceed with it. Mr. Speaker. I only wish that our President and Secretary of the Treasury now had the courage and backbone of old Jackson and Manning. for our people have been robbed and plundered. imposed upon. and ground down by this as well as many other schemes and rascalities of those in power. acting in concert with the gold bugs. etc.. till it has gotten to where it hurts. The people feel it. and are crying out for relief and help. but our officials and the money power answer back. ""Bear it. its the best."" It reminds me. gentlemen. of the farmer and his little boy who had a bull pup they were training to catch hogs. The farmer would get down on his all fours and the little boy would set the puppy after him. So one day the old fellow got down and capered around like a pig. and the little boy turned the pup loose and said. ""Sic him. sic him. pup"". and the pup ran up to the old man and caught him by the ear. and began to bite the old fellow pretty hard. and it began to hurt. and he commenced to squall. ""Take himoff! Take himoffl Ithurts! Ithurts! Take him off!"" And the little boy. standing a little way off enjoying the fun. ran up. and patting the old man on the back. said. "" Stand it. pappy! Standit. pappy! Bear it if you can. I knowits hellon you. but."" says he."" its the very making of the dog."" So that is the answer that our national officials and the money power give the people when they cry out for relief from the present financial system of the country: ""Stand it. stand it. bear it if you can. We know its hell on you. but its the very making of us."" But. Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of this House. I want to give you warning right here and right now that the people have stood this about as long as they propose to. and you must give them relief or else they Will leave you at home and send men here to the next Congress who will do something for them. and in my opinion. under the present circumstances. the best way to start is to vote for the bill now before this House. and give the country back its moneygive them free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. and that will at least be one step in the right direction. As often said by others and by the press of the country. whatever may have been hoped by gold monometallists at the time of the first bond issue two years ago. it is now admitted that nothing of a permanent nature can be gained by the sale of bonds for gold. Borrowing gold can no longer be regarded in any other light than a costly makeshift and at best than a means of temporarily postponing suspension of gold payments. Such a state of affairs is eminently unsatisfactory. The necessity of borrowing gold is as annoying and unsatisfactory to gold theorists as the blind policy pursued by Mr. Cleveland that occasions it. is humiliating to the masses of our people. Also. for the difficulties that confront the Treasury. gold monometallists have but one panacea. a contraction of the currency. Gold Democrats and gold Republicans alike have but one remedy to suggest. As much as the remedy asked for by Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Carlisle and the remedy proposed by Mr. DINGLEY and",1896-02-08,wr.

1753475,540018402,"I did not see that. and there must be a mistake about it. for the reason that he discusses in his report the Revised Statutes very fully and claims to understand them. Very naturally. when he had to take hold of the question and act upon it. his attention was called to it. it was his duty then to examine it thoroughly. and he did so. Not only that. but. in further reply to the question which was put to me by the Senator from Louisiana. I say that when imposition was practiced upon the Department in this way he saw at once that it was running riot and going far beyond the intention and spirit of the law. and being satisfied of that. it was his duty to draw these sellers of seed back to the legal line. and that he sought to do. Did he go at it in a proper manner. Mr. President? What was the first thing he did when he came to examine this statute in the face of these impositions and extravagances that were being practiced upon the Government? He went to the proper officer. the AttorneyGeneral. whose duty it is to give him information and to construe a statute that he has to execute. That duty of the AttorneyGeneral applies to this Secretary as it does to the Secretary of the Treasury and all other officers of the Government. Indeed. that is what the AttorneyGeneral is for. He is the legal adviser of those who belong to the Administration with him. But does the Secretary go at it hastily? Does he show any ill temper in regard to it? Does he show that he has a prejudice against the distribution of seeds? No. sir. but he very properly puts his application to him in writing. It is here. and has been read heretofore by the Senator from Mississippi . I say he puts it in writing. not frivolously nor peevishly. but deliberately and sensibly. and has it sent to the AttorneyGeneral. asking for his construction of section 527 of the Revised Statutes. which. in conjunction with section 3709. is the basis of the law under which he then and now operates in the purchase of seeds. etc. Section 527 has to be construed. and what is the construction that is given to it by the AttorneyGeneral? Let us see if this Secretary ought to be ""hung and quartered."" abused. and denounced because he has seen fit. as it has been charged. to violate this statute while holding his high and responsible place. It has been said by grave Senators that he ought to be constrained to carry out this Congressional act as heretofore. and that he ""deliberately. premeditatedly. and maliciously"" violated the law. Now. let us see what this man has done in regard to that matter. This section 527 will show whatthe lawis that guides him. And as it is the initial point of this question. so far as his action is concerned. I will read it: The purchase and distribution of seed by the Department of Agriculture shall be confined to sucheeds as are rare and uncommon to the country. or such as can be made more profitable by frequent changes from one part of our country to another. and the purchase or propagation and distribution of trees. plants. shrubs. vines. and cuttings shall be confined to such as are adapted to general cultivation and to proniote the general interest of horticulture and agriculture throughout the United States. In connection with this I will say that every annual appropriation for the purchase. propagation. and distribution of valuable seed since the said section 527 was in force contains the words ""as required by law."" showing that every purchase must conform I to the terms used in it. and it requires that the seed so purchased shall be ""rare and uncommon to the country. or such as can be made more profitable by frequent changes from one part of our country to another."" The AttorneyGeneral. as I said. was appealed to. and what was his reply to the question as to the construction of this statute? I will read his reply: The reply of the AttorneyGeneral informed the Secretaryof Agriculture that (1) - the seeds purchasable under the act of March 2.1895. are limited to those described in section 527 of the Revised Statutes. there being no reasonable ground for claiming that the act of Mlarch 2.1895. operates. or was intended to operate. as a repeal of the earlier statute "". (2) that ""if not obligatory upon the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase seeds. trees. etc.. conformably to section 3709 of the Revised Statutes. it is certainly competent for him to make the purchases conformably to said statute. the right to reject any and all bids being reserved."" etc. The question that presents itself to the Senate is. has he done that? He has exercised the right. it is true. but has he conformed to section 527 of the Revised Statutes? I think there can be nothing clearer. He went to the AttorneyGeneral for advice and he got that which I have read. He then advertises. under section 3709. and so particular was he in his advertisement that he followed the very language of the law. and does not give his construction nor that of anyone. but leaves it to the seed men themselves to act upon the language of the law in furnishing the kind and quality of seed required. Does he send forth the advertisement in time? Look to the testimony that we had before the Agricultural Committee and it will be seen that he advertised in the month of April and it ran until the 1st of July. Did he make a limited advertisement? No. sir. it was a most extended one. and in those papers that were usual for such advertisements. and it appeared all over the country. Not only that. but he issued a prospectus and sent it to every man of note engaged in the seed business in the United States. and there are 152 of them who make a specialty of it. and the proof shows that he sent one to each of those and that he advertised in all proper places. Is there any fault to be found with him in his proceeding under this section of the law? I can see none yet. Then. what was the next step he took? There were some responses made to the advertisement. They came to him as the chief officer at the head of that Department. What did he do next? He appointed a board of investigation to examine the quality. kind. and character of these seeds. to see if they came up to the statute requirement. This board examined the seeds thoroughly. and strange to say. notwithstanding all the advertisements. there were only about $1.485 worth of seeds presented. and why? It shows. to my mind. and to that of any other unprejudiced man who will look at it fairly. that heretofore they had been just dumping their old seeds of every character and kind. old and new. good and bad. upon this Department in the absence of rigid investigation of them. The Secretary of Agriculture had found this out. and he had put forth in the advertisement that they must present their seeds in accordance with the statute. and he quoted the statute. and when they came to giving a specific description. as required. and putting on record the character and kind of seeds as rare and uncommon. or seeds which it would be better to exchange from one locality of the country to another. these seed men did not care to do it. Therefore. you see. their game was blocked. I say to the Senator from Louisiana that their game was blocked to such extent as to forbid their bringing any more seed under the conditions of the law and under therequirement of the advertisement made by the chief of this Department. As is shown by the report I hold in my hand. only $1.485 worth of seed was offered. The Secretary intended to carry out thelaw as far ashe could with rugged honesty and rigid economy. Here was the amount of money appropriated by Congress. and he wanted to dispose of it in good faith even to the small extent offered. He appointed three men. according to law. and they examined these seed. What did those men say in their report after examining these seed? I will presently read four or five lines of their report to show. But pray. who are these men? That I will also presently show. I will not go over the character of seeds. or grasses. or plants. or anything that were sent here to be purchased by this officer. because that has been done fully by the Senator from Mississippi in his speech opening this debate. in which he gave a vein of rich and grotesque humor that threw it into ridicule. especially the flower seed and grasses. As it was so impressed upon everyone who heard him. I shall not repeat or even allude to the ridiculous kind and amount of seed offered. but I wish to state how much of this $1.485 wofth of seed. which was all that came under this advertisement. would be to each Congressman. I quote from the report: This would under the law have been less than 10 pounds of field and farm seed to each Senator. Representative. and Delegate in Congress if every pound offered had been bought. Having received no bids that came up to the requirements of the statutes and offered anything worthy of consideration. the board rejected them all and submitted the following report: Here is their report: The undersigned board. appointed by you on July 1. 1895. to open and examine bids for seeds to be furnished this Department for distribution according to law during the fiscal year ending Jul 1. 189. have the honor to report that we have opened and examined the ids received. and find that the same do not meet the requirements of the advertisement as printed. and therefore respectfully recommend that all bids be rejected. What. then. was left to this officer but to follow the advice that was given by this board. a proper board. appointed from his own Department. and who were experienced seed men and experts in the business? I ask what was left the Secretary to do but that which he did? Nothing. and in acting as he did he has followed the letter and intention of the law. We have heard intimations by Senators that this board was composed of his ""underlings."" Who are they? This report is signed by Enos S. Harnden. F. L. Evans. and J. B. Bennett. Who is Mr. Evans? I understand he is a gentleman who has been in. first the Bureau and then the Department of Agriculture. from his boyhood. and is a part and parcel of the machinery of that concern. against whom there has never been uttered a word of complaint. and he is kept there on account of his ability as an exipert. Who is Mr. Bennett? He is a man brought there from Wisconsin by Secretary Rusk. a man of Secretary Rushs own party. a Republican. The present Secretary of Agriculture found him there and kept him. Who is Mr. Harnden? A professional seed man. brought from the State of Illinois. and his salary was dependent upon the purchase and distribution of seeds. Yet that man. and I applaud him as a man of virtue and honor. when he found the condition of things. although knowing that his occupation. like Othellos. would be gone. provided the Denartment did not make any purchases of seedyet he decides 1i once. along with the others. that it would be improper under the circumstances to purchase these seeds. or any such. and therefore he is out of his job. and today. for aught I know. is hunting employment. That is the character of men by whom this report was written. They made a just decision. and I say it is a feather in their cap that they so decided the question and decided it on the facts they had before them. They investigated the seed and they found that many of them were old. and. furthermore. that the price was unreasonable. and they so stated in their report to the Secretary. and he refused to make the purchase. That is the history of this case. In this connection. the Senator from North Dakota. who most persistently. vigilantly. and ably represents in part that State. wanted to know why there was not a readvertisement when only about $1.485 worth of seeds were received. which. under the statute. iwere not ""rare and uncommon."" He claimed to have found an antiquated statute authorizing it. but when produced it soon fell a victim to the legal mind of the Senator from Mississippi . who first analyzed and then buried it. and it has not since been referred to. Therefore I assert there is no authority for a readvertisement. Not only so. but it would have been too late to readvertise. and if done would have been wvithout any effect whatever. But the money was not expended. and it hurts the feelings of some executive officers to have public money in their hands with the privilege of spending it and not do it. The Secretary of Agriculture. however. is an exception to that rule. He takes care of public money when in his official hands. and. as his official reports show. has not expended the amount appropriated to his Department. but covered it into the Treasury. As the Secretary is being so severely tried. you will pardon me for saying something in regard to his economy. for I want to see justice done him and that he has the benefit of truth and the law. however much I may differ with him in some of his opinions. The Senator from Missouri [Mr. VESTJ most facetiously. most eloquently. and sarcastically. and mercilessly. if I may say so. criticised the Secretary of Agriculture for having extravaganly purchased flower seed and all that. I think the Senator is mistaken in regard to the quantity of money that was given for the purpose to which he referred. and I believe it ought to be corrected. and I have no doubt he will admit the correction when he learns the facts. The Senator said. in his speech delivered on the 5th instant. to be found on page 1508 of the RECORD: But let us look further at the question of economy. He overlooked other appropriations made for his own Department. but struck out the $130.9000 appropriation for the farmers. I find. from the report of the Secretary of lxeniures made in the Agricultural Department for the year 1895. that $.5..0was expended upon the conservatories and grounds of the Agricultural Department. That is correct. but then the Senator goes on to say: For 1897. etc. I do not understand why 1897 is referred to. It applies to the future. however. and I suppose it is not necessary to refer to that. I do not care to do so. The Senator continues: Will some Senator tell me what human being is fed by this expenditure? Will some Senatoroint out to me what table of any poor man has been made more comfortable by reason of this expenditure of $105.000 Wheore dosthis tax money of decied the uethe immediate eye of the Secretary of Agriculture? The Senator says $105.000 was expended for these purposes ""under the immediate eye of the Secretary of Agriculture."" Then he proceeds to say: It goes to the purchase of orchids. lilies of the valley. giant palms. and exotics that grace the banquets and receptions of the President and Cabinet officers in this city. Ilr. President. I have made inquiry into this. I have looked into the reports. and I have examined the law as to who has charge of these matters. and it may surprise the Senate when I state the fact that not a green sprig or an evergreen. not a rosebud bursting with its imprisoned sweets. not a fullblown flower laden with fragrance. nor any other floral productof the Agricultural Department since under its present chief. if ever. has gone from the Agricultural Department to the White House or to the tables of any of the Cabinet ministers.

2003654,550119128,"Let me call your attention to a scene of the great dramatist. where Othello amuses the leisure of Brabantio with recounting his wonderful adventures by sea and land. to hear which the fair Desdemona did most studiously incline and among those perils there was one specially mentioned. that of being taken captive and sold in slavery to the insolent foe. The ruler who attempts to sell the Republic of Cuba or the people of that republic into slavery for. the Spanish debt will commit a sin unpardonable. not to be forgiven either in this world or the next. Now we know what the situation is. The eloquent Senator from Kentucky fully explained that law. not only law. but the Axerican construction of it. If we go down there and take possession of Cuba and hold it for future disposition. we take it as conquerors subject to the debt charged upon the islandsubject to the Spanish fours chargeable upon Cuban receipts. If we after wards transfer it by establishing or recognizing a government in that island. we transfer it only subject to the same debt and the same bondage. Bow. then. shall we. for our own safety. deal with this international question? There is but one way. It is to recognize the independence of Cuba before the sovereignty of the island rests in us by conquest. That disposes of the question of Spanish bonds. and they will not be disposed of in any other manner. Mr. President. we shall put our trust in the God of battles. that out of this feebleness. this delay and infirmity. out of this darkness and mystery His omnipotent hand will work great gain to the cause of liberty. a larger room for the feet of freemen. a manifest and final delivery from the system of monarchical oppression and despotism wherever it obtains. and especially in the heretofore Spanish islands of the Mediterranean of the West. Mr. President. whatever may be his high position in military or civil life. he must be a laggard in perception who looks upon the scope and purview of such an appeal to arms as we have made as a mere occasion for the recital of battles. marches. sieges. or escapes in the imminent deadly breach. We of the United States have for the last quarter of a century stood by in unmoved silence. hardly even as observers. while one grand division of the earths surface just south of the Mediterranean has been. from the Isthmus of Suez to the Cape of Good Hope. partitioned. subdivided among the great powers as the first triumvirate divided among themselves the Roman world. We have during the same period beheld aggressions. annexations. and allotment by the same nationalities of the country of the far East. Out of the flame and flash of that heroic. victorious sea fight at Manila we may become more interested lookerson in the distant Orient. These present treaty acquisitions of territory will. before the close of the next century. ripen into partitions like those of Africa. which shall include every arable acre from the Caucasus to the Chinese seas. We shall at that time be flanked east and west by great populations adverse and inimical to free and popular government. by the diplomacy of the balance of power as between the European nations. extended and thoroughly applied to Asia and to Africa. by the subtle approach of foreign force and influence. backed by vast armies and navies. who will assure us of their distinguished consideration. but who will entertain the unappeasable hunger for further territorial extension. and will conceive the notion that the doctrine of the balance of power extended upon the European schedule shall at least apply to the little countries of Central America and to certain portions of the east and west coast of South America. It is. then. for the highest interest of our future peace and safety that these European international aspirations in respect to terri-. torial increment in this hemisphere should now. at this time. be forever barred. foreclosed. and forbidden. Who is to do this? The United States in its history. growth. and development of more than a hundred and twenty years has obtained a conceded supremacy among American governments. We have not assumed this. It has come to us with the time and tide of events. We can not evade. defer. or deny the responsibility of this headship. Over against this worldgrasping policy of the balance of power we place and for many years have maintained the doctrine of Monroe. and especially in respect to the Island of Cuba. announced with distinct emphasis in the manifesto of Ostend forty years ago. Let me read this document in the words of its great author: In the wars of the European powers. in matters relating to themselves. we have never taken any part. nor does it comport with our policy so to do. With the existing colonies or dependencies of any European power in this hemisphere we have not interfered. and shall not interfere. but with the government who have declared their own independence and maintained it we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. Who believes that Cuba is now an existing colony of Spain. or that it has been such since February. 1895. the commencement of the second period of the war of the revolution? We are thus pledged to consider as an enemy. and we have declared Spain to e an enemy. of the United States. as we would have declared any other power that intervened to oppress the Cuban Republic or to control its destiny in any other manner. I would just as soon recede to Great Britain Staten Island or Long Island as to agree to recede to Spain any portion of the territory of the Island of Cuba. This was indeed a great declaration. Our action should comport with our words. In so doing we show to the world that we are worthy of that primacy. that ascendency in American polity wherewith we are clothed. All our history in every stage leads up to this high prerogative. All our wars have been fought and won to this end and purpose. reserved to us not by fate or fortune. but by an overruling Providence. guiding our steps and the footsteps of our forefathers. leading kindly on even up to this hour. Every shot fired from the days of Concord and Lexington to those of Gettysburg and Appomattox promoted and foreshadowed thisourascendency. Every bayonet gleamed with this meaning. That is what the war with Spain means. that is its interpretation and significance. It means the primacy of the United States in the affairs of the American Hemispherea disposing and controlling primacy. not to be denied or questioned. I do not say unto you. ""Tell it not."" I say tell it. publish it in Gath. in Askelon. in London. Paris. Berlin. in the Winter Palace on the banks of the Neva. Proclaim we have a primacy among the nationalities of the New World. There is but one power in Europe who really apprehends and understands this primacy. who knows what it will cost to deny or to defy it. who knows also how much it would cost us to falter or to fail in its maintenance. There is only one Government in Europe which has challenged this primacy and has resorted to the arbitrament of the sword to annul and abrogate it. Spain is the first. and it will be the last European Government to take this course. It is a nation not only at war against us. but against liberty. against humanity. against the civilization of the age. There can be but one issue of such a quarrel. Liberty intrenched in this continent will here prevail. In this faith we have already subdued kingdoms. wrought righteousness. more than once closed the mouth of the lion. and we may curb and conquer more powerful enemies than Spain. The victory that shall crown our arms will not be our success alone. It will be the triumph of evenhanded justice over those ancient Bourbons of the Escurial. who have in the waste and lapse of centuries learned nothing of good and forgotten nothing of evil. These malign offenders have attempted to crush human freedom. They themselves will be subjected to a great and exceeding overthrow.",1898-05-18,Mr. TURPIE,,, ,TURPIE,S,M, 
2018392,550133866,"Mr. Speaker. I shall not consume any of the time which has been allotted to me for debate on the pending resolution in useless exordium. but shall proceed at once to the very heart of the controversy. I affirm. sir. and I shall endeavor to maintain before the House and the country. three propositions: First. That the annexation of Hawaii to the United States is not necessary as a war measure in our conflict with Spain. Second. That the annexation of the island is not necessary in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of some other great power. to be used by it to menace and attack our coast. Third. That the annexation of Hawaii is of itself inherently wrong. and that it is the opening wedge which is designed to lead. and which will lead to still further acquisitions of insulated foreign territory. and that such i policy is against the best interest of the country. and therefore ought not to be entered upon. Now. sir. let us consider the first of these propositions. It has been contended in this debate that the present war makes it necessary that. in order to maintain ourselves against Spain in the Philippine Islands and prevent her from sending there for our overthrow a new navy and army. which it is claimed she is likely to do. we should annex Hawaii for our use as a coaling station and for a base of supplies for our operations in the Philippines. Mr. Speaker. this war with Spain does not furnish a single additional argument in favor of the annexation of this island that did not exist before the conflict was precipitated. It does not strengthen the position of the annexationist one particle. It furnishes simply a pretext for annexation. not a reason for it. What is the condition of affairs in the Philippine Islands today? Commodore Dewey. with his heroic sailors. has swept out of existence the only fleet which Spain had in Asiatic waters. His squadron lies unopposed in the harbor of Manila. That city is under the guns of his victorious fleet and is completely at his mercy. According to his own dispatches. his .sailors are in high spirits and excellept health. and his vessels are entirely uninjured. He has seized upon the islands at the mouth of the harbor. and has fortified them. He has laid submarine mines in the harbor in order that he may be protected against any possible contingency which may arise. The insurgents are swarming upon the walls of the doomed city. cutting off its communications. and anxious to cooperate with our fleet in bringing about its capture or capitulation. The very last dispatches sent from Manila by the Spanish captaingeneral to the home Government at Madrid are filled with tidings of dismay. He declares therein that while he will make the best resistance within his power. it is absolutely impossible for him to withstand the combined forces of our fleet and of the insurgents. Mr. Speaker. under such circumstances as these. what is the simple duty of our Government? That which it is already performing. the sending to Commodore Dewey of supplies and an army of occupation sufficiently large to enable him to land and man the forts which he has captured. and to take possession of the city and preserve peace and order. Already the Government has sent some troops and supplies to his assistance. More troops are being mobilized upon the Pacific coast and will soon follow in their wake. We have done more than this. We have reenforced him with vessels of war. We have sent to him the Charleston. now well on her way. The Monterey. one of the most powerful vessels in our Navy. is even now following in her trail. and the Monadnock. conceded to be the most formidable monitor that we have afloat. is soon to take her departure for the same destination. I hesitate not to affirm upon this floor that if the combined navies of Spain could be precipitated upon Manila today Commodore Dewey. thus equipped with the new vessels that have been sent to his relief. could and would absolutely exterminate and destroy that entire navy. But. sir. is there any man fool enough to believe that Spain can send at this time either a navy or an army to the relief of her doomed colony in the Philippinesthat they will take their slow and tortuous passage through the Mediterranean. thence through the Isthmus of Suez. out into the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. and on through the Indian Ocean to their destination? And where is the Spanish fleet that is able to come to the rescue of Manila? I challenge those who demand this annexation as a war measure to answer. The pride of Spains navy is this hour closely blockaded inside the narrowmouthed and rockribbed harbor of Santiago de Cuba. absolutely incapable of escape or rescue. with an American squadron far outnumbering it in valor and in power awaiting it upon the outside. and the American Army is just about to assail the city of Santiago from the land side with a power which is irresistible. It is only a question of a few days. sir. until those Spanish vessels of war will be absolutely destroyed or compelled to unconditionally surrender. Is any man fool enough to believe that Spain dare send the only other squadron which she possesses. that which is designated as the Cadiz squadron and which is now maneuvering off the coast of Spain. to the Philippine Islands to relieve her forces there? The very moment she attempts it. she leaves her own coast and the Canary Islands. which she owns. and which lie off the coast of northern Africa. the one to be ravaged and the other to be attacked and captured by the formidable fleet which we can with perfect ease and safety spare from our naval operations in the Caribbean Sea against Cuba and Puerto Rico. Nor is it possible to dispatch a Spanish army to the Philippines. for how can an army be sent without vessels of war to act as its convoy? Mr. Speaker. in view of these facts which I have stated. and which can not be successfully controverted. I affirm that the man who declares that there is any military or urgent necessity that we should. for the relief of Commodore Dewey. annex the Hawaiian Islands to the United States simply insults the intelligence of the gentlemen to whom he makes such an argument. And now. gentlemen. answer me for one moment. upon what ground do you want Hawaii for the purpose of holding the Philippines during this var? Accord me. if you please. definite and specific reasons. Do not attempt to put me off either by dogmatic assertion or by glittering generalities. Do you expect to obtain men from there to carry on the war in the distantprovince? Not at all. You will not get a man there. Every soldier you get will have to come from under the shadow of the American flag. from our own domain. on this side of the Pacific. Is it intended to transport American soldiers to Hawaii. land them there. and then reembark them for Asiatic waters? No. sir. our forces will go direct from the great city of San Fraicisco. You say we want a coaling station at Hawaii. Why can we not do as we have already started to do. and as every other nation is obliged to do where she undertakes to send her war ships a great distance and possesses no intermediate coaling station. load up the decks of our war ships. load up their bunkers with all the coal we can deposit there. and then take colliers along and load the war ships with coal in the open sea? Oh. but you say that this method is inconvenient and expensive. Possibly this may be true. but the inconvenience is nothing and the expense is nothing to what we will have to encounter if we are to enter upon this policy of annexing the islands to the United States. You say. too. that the proposition to coal at sea involves delay. You talk as if Spain had a powerful fleet in the waters of the Pacific or a great army in the Philippines. and as though our heroic Navy there was in danger of being crushed out of existence by sudden and overwhelming attack. whereas. as I have already shown. just the opposite is the case. Our troops and our war ships would arrive at Manila in ample time and without injurious delay even were the vessels denied coaling facilities at the Sandwich Islands. All that can be said as an argument in favor of Hawaii as a basis for operations in the Philippines during the present war is that it would be a conveniencea mere convenience. No conscientious man who cares anything for his own standing or reputation will assert that it is a necessity. Let me put a square question to the rabid annexationists of this House. who pretend that annexation is an imperative necessity growing out of the war. If the Sandwich Islands today were in the possession of France. Germany. or Great Britain. or any other powerful nation which was enforcing the laws of neutrality against us. or was denying us the right to coal there. do you not very well know that we would. nevertheless. be able to send both war ships and troops to Commodore Dewey without appreciable difficulty or delay? But. Mr. Speaker. it is admitted that we already possess a coaling station in this island. that we have collected at Honolulu a large quantity of coal. and that. by permission of the Government of Hawaii. our war vessels and transports stop there and coal en route to the Orient. Gentlemen upon this floor have tried to draw on the sympathies of the American people by talking of the unselfish and patriotic love which these people have shown for us by thus defying the laws of neutrality in our behalf. Let us not forget that this is owing to us. from the fact that for years we have protected the people of Hawaii and have guaranteed and secured to them independence against all foreign aggression. Let us not forget that it is our due. because by an unwise and onesided treaty we have put millions of dollars into the pockets of the Hawaiian people by the admission of their products free of tariff duties. It has been said. too. by gentlemen that if we do not annex these islands. when peace is declared between Spain and ourselves she will claim damages and collect them from these people for their violation of neutrality laws in our interest. and that she will punish them. All such talk. sir. is absurd. To assert that weak and impotent Spain. Spain who is unable to protect her own possessions in the Pacific. who is unable to go to the rescue of her own provinces in the Philippine Islands. can levy any damages against Hawaii or punish her because she has given us an opportunity to enter her ports and coal there during the existence of this war is simply ridiculous. Do gentlemen forget that the same fostering care upon our part that has maintained Hawaiian independence in the past will be exerted. if need be. to protect her hereafter. and that in the treaty of peace with Spain. a treaty that will be dictated by the United States. a clause can and will be inserted if necessary. upon our deinand. releasing all claims against the Hawaiian Government by the Madrid authorities for any aid she may have afforded us during the existence of hostilities. If Spain desires to visit punishment on the Hawaiian people. we can defend them when they are independent as well as though they are annexed to our own soil. We can easily come to their rescue without the necessity of political union with them. But something else has transpired. Mr. Speaker. in connection with this flimsy pretext of military necessity for annexation. What is it? The Canadian Pacific Railway Company. in its excursions around the world. starting from England. crosses the Atlantic Ocean by a steamship line which runs to Quebec. thence its course is across the lower portion of Canada to Vancouver Island. from which point its line of steamships ply directly north. right near the Aleutian Islands. south of Alaskaislands owned and possessed by ourselvesthence to Yokohama. Japan. and on to Hongkong. China. very near to the Philippines. This is a wellestablished route. a route over which those seeking pleasure. those whose safety is to be preserved. are taken by this great Canadian corporation. You will observe this route plainly marked on the printed map of the world. with a North Pole projection. which now hangs upon the rack in front of the desk of the Speaker. marked there by the printers and publishers of the maps themselves. We have been by Government officials toldand no man can dispute it to be truethat right among these Aleutian Islands is a magnificent harbor. in an island belonging to ourselves. a harbor that is accessible and deep. well protected on every side. and capable of accommodating vessels of the heaviest tonnage. and a harbor splendidly adapted for a coaling station. It is in evidence by gentlemen living on the Pacific slope who can rise here. if necessary. and verify the statementindeed. it is a fact quite well known to all acquainted with Pacific coast transportation linesthat there are three lines of steamships plying from that coast near Seattle and Tacoma. which pass close to the Aleutian Islands over the same excursion route I have mentioned to Yokohama and Hongkong. These lines. sir. transport passengers as well as freight and run the year round. One is an English line. one is an American line. and the other is a Japanese line. It is also in evidence here. being certified to by Government officials whose right and duty it is to speak on such subjects and who speak intelligently and knowingly. that this Aleutian route to the Philippines is 600 to 1.000 miles shorter than the route by Hawaii. This fact is also conceded upon this floor. It has also been certified to by those who occupy a high position as Government officials and who axe acquainted with the facts. that the temperature on this route is not severe. and that at no season of the year is that line of travel obstructed by ice or by any other impediment. Senator PETTIGREW. who traveled to Asia by this northern route and came back by the southern route last summer. I believe. declares that the length of time consumed by him in covering the outgoing route was three days less than that occupied by him on the return voyage by way of the Sandwich Islands. Admiral Walker. himself a strong annexationist. in his hearing recently before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House. used the following language. which bears directly upon the matter I am now discussing. and which is doubly valuable. coming as it does from so biased a witness: Steamers run both ways. and in crossingtoShanghailarge steamers. which carry an abundance of coal. go farther north than the islands (Sandwich). They sweep up toward the Aleutian Islands. because of the shape of the earth. which makes it a shorter distance across. I am aware of the fact that the gentleman from Ohio has introduced here a statement prepared by Commodore Melville. a naval officer. in which he states that this Aleutian route is not a good one. for the reason that it abounds in fogs. for the reason that there are rocks along the coast. and for the additional reason that at various times of the year the passageway is clogged with ice. The naval officer. sir. who made that certificate is as bitter a partisan in favor of annexation as the gentleman from Ohio. or as you and I can possibly be in our opposition to what we consider to be a dangerous scheme. Every word he says is to be taken with a grain of allowance. It is not the impartial declaration of aman who has no feeling one way or the other and is simply interested in placing all the facts before the House. but that of a person with strong prejudice. unduly anxious to promote the passage of the pending resolution. His certificate. therefore. is entitled to be weighed as an argument rather than accepted as a fact. How much importance. Mr. Speaker. is to be attached td the statement of this naval officer as against the actual fact that the excursionists of the Canadian Pacific road are taken over the northern route. and that three different steamship lines for passengers and freight travel over it the whole year round. Think you. sir. that this would occur if the line of travel was obscured by fog or impeded by shoals. rocks. or ice? Would the pleasure of excursionists be enhanced by such a route? Would the Canadian Pacific Railroad Company transport its tourist passengers over lines so perilous? These things speak volumes in refutation of the evidence which the gentleman from Ohio has presented to this House. and clearly demonstrate the existence of at least as good and a speedier route to the Philippines than the one which touches at Hawaii. a route. too. where excellent coaling facilities can be easily provided en route at a magnificent harbor already our own. Now. Mr. Speaker. I think I have sufficiently demonstrated my first proposition. I say that among all the flimsy pretexts that have been laid before this House of Representatives to induce members to vote to abandon our old policy of nonintervention and venture into the acquisition of insular territory. not a single one has been so devoid of reason. so false in point of fact. as this declaration that it is necessary we should own Hawaii in order that we may maintain ourselves in the Philippine Islands during the progress of the present war with Spain. Ah. sir. the annexation of this island is not being urged simply because we want to have a base for present operations or in the belief that we intend. when the war is over and we have exacted from Spain an indemnity. to turn the Philippines back to her. or in case she does not pay the indemnity. that we will dispose of them to some other nation at something like their reasonable value. but annexation is being urged upon this floor because it is the purpose of those who urge it that we shall acquire and use Hawaii as a base of supplies for the permanent holding of the Asiatic territory which the heroism of Dewey and his victorious sailors has delivered into our grasp. This is one thing. Mr. Speaker. which induces me to declare that instead of the war being a reason why we should now proceed to annex Hawaii. it furnishes every reason why we should defer all action in the matter until a more suitable occasion. when we can ascertain all the facts and consequences in the premises and come to a deliberate conclusionone which will not come back to plague us in the years that are to come. Considering the question of the annexation of Hawaii alone and as an independent proposition. it is to my mind by all odds the gravest and most farreaching proposition in its effect upon the American people which they have been called upon to confront since the days of the civil war. not even excepting the very vital question of finance itself. But. Mr. Speaker. as I have said. the annexation of Hawaii is not the ultimatum of the annexationists. It is but the entering wedge. Permit this act to be done. and you gain an impetus which you will find it difficult to resist. Its avowed purpose. its natural tendency. its iresistible consequence means that we are to proceed still further in extending our possessions and in the acquisition of foreign territory in no wise contiguous to our soil. And this above all others is the reason why I am now disposed to antagonize it upon this floor. Let no gentleman be vain enough to imagine that he can vote to annex Hawaii to the United States and then stop short in the career. or hold back from still further encroachments his ambitious colleagues whose appetite for territorial acquisition he has thus whetted rather than satisfied. He will awaken sooner or later to find out that he has set in motion a current which he is powerless to resist. and which. in spite of himself. will sweep him into the vortex below and inflict upon his country and his posterity numerous evils far beyond his ability ever to repair. Yes. Mr. Speaker. the question is not simply whether we shall annex Hawaii. Gentlemen need not attempt to deny it. they shall not avoid it. they must come out squarely from behind the breastworks and meet us in the open on this proposition. Even now many of the newspapers of the country are declaring that we ought permanently to occupy the Philippines. This suggestion is in the very atmosphere that permeates this Chamber. It is openly avowed in conversation by many members on this floor. A determined effort is being made in certain quarters to bring about a concentration of public opinion in this direction. Its promoters are masquerading under the pretense of military necessity. They are already prating about our ""manifest destiny."" telling us that the time has arrived for us to assume among the nations of the etarh the position to which our great power entitles us and seeking to play upon the vanity and excite the cupidity of the people. And something still more significantI see by the newspapers. and I doubt not that it is true. because it is consistent with all he has done up to this time upon the subject of annexationthat the President of the United States has said that he is very anxious that we shall be able to get possession of Puerto Rico before Spain has an opportunity to sue for peace. Upon what ground is this desired? Are not the Philippines sufficiently valuable to secure to us any claim for indemnity which we can reasonably make against Spain? And how is it with respect to Cuba? I know it has been said from the White House that we do not propose to enter into a war for acquisition of territory. and that such a policy would be a crime against all our traditions. I know it was declared in the war resolution which passed this House and the Senate that we disavowed any purpose to appropriate Cuba to ourselves. and that our only desire and object was to insure her independence and a stable form of government. I am not here to say that every man who joined in that declaration was insincere. but I am here to maintain that men sometimes forget and that men sometimes change their opinions for reasons which they deem sufficient to justify them in such conduct. We have always coveted the fair isle of Cuba. Once in possession of it. shall we not begin to reflect what it has cost us to gain a lodgment there? Will we be disposed. with great expense incurred and much precious blood shed in her behalf. and with Spain. as you contend. practically bankrupt and unable. or perhaps unwilling. to pay us a money indemnity. to withdraw from the island? Will we not be attracted by its salubrious climate and its fertile soil? If a formal tender of the island be deemed necessary to afford us an excuse for forgetting our highsounding declarations and for breaking our promises. will not a nondescript crowd be gathered from out of its motley population which will hold itself together. under a government upon paper. long enough to invite our avarice and secure our acceptance? Ah. sir. already we are beginning to belittle these Cuban patriots. Already we are beginning to characterize them as disorganized guerrillas. utterly incapable of maintaining an organized warfare. already we are talking about their incapacity for selfgovernment and the inadvisability of putting any one class of them in control for fear it will wreak its vengeance on the other class. already we are prating about our obligation to establish a stable government if it takes years to do so. already we are felicitating ourselves that we did not declare their independence. the significance of which omission. sir. is now plainly apparent to even the ordinary mind. Mr. Speaker. is there not grave danger that this holy crusade for liberty and the independence of Cuba is liable after all to end in a disgraceful scramble for spoils. a scramble as disgraceful as any that ever characterized the people of ancient Rome? Is there not serious danger that this war for humanity. this righteous uprising to save the people of Cuba from starvation. which so far has resulted in a blockade under which the Spanish soldiery has thrived and many of the remaining concentrados have starved to death. will yet degenerate into a miserable war of conquest for the possession of territory? Sir. with all these grave questions staring us in the face. what kind of a time is this for us to discuss and pass upon that which is intended to be the first step in this ""march to emnire""? Is there a disposition here to commit the American people. suddenly and before they can have an opportunity for calm thought and reflection. to a policy which will inevitably result in their injury. and which they will condemn when they have the time to grasp it in all its aspects and weigh it in all its consequences? Are we not acting here for posterity as well as for ourselves? Why is it that gentlemen rush with indecent haste to pass this resolution now? Why is it that they are absolutely unwilling even to submit it to the people to be discussed pro and con at the polls at the next election? Such a discussion. Iaffirm. they have never enjoyed. When the first treaty for Hawaiian annexation. sir. was sent to the Senate by President Harison. and was thereafter soon withdrawn by President Cleveland. there was some discussion of this subject in the papers. The matter then. comparatively speaking. dropped out of the public mind until the present Chief Executive sent the second treaty for annexation to the other end of the Capitol. Every word of discussion that was uttered upon the proposition to accept that treaty. though it dragged along for weary weeks. was uttered behind closed doors. where the American people could not hear a solitary word that was said or get the benefit of the arguments that were made for and against the proposal which involved to them consequences of the most vital and farreaching importance. This is the first time in all the history of Hawaiian annexation that they have had an opportunity to hear an open discussion of this grave subject in Congress. and yet. sirs. you persist in withholding from them the benefits that will accrue from it by forcing the vote today at 5 oclock. before they can have time to get the RECORD into their possession and to weigh the arguments which have been and are still being submitted. Sir. I insist that this proposition for annexation should be postponed until after the next election. when our constituents can have the advantage of the arguments which have been made. and to the end that we may then come back here as their representatives. fully advised as to their judgment. given upon due deliberation. prepared thereby to execute whatever may prove to be their will. Indeed. Mr. Speaker. it would be the part of wisdom to defer this whole matter of Hawaiian annexation until the close of the war. along with these other great questions of insular acquisitions so closely allied to it. which concern the weal or the woe of the great American people. that we may take them up then. not amidst scenes of excitement. not in passion. not under the coercion of party discipline or party prejudice. not at a time when men have only superficial views upon the matter and are forced to act upon firstblush impressions. or. having honest opinions well matured. dare not declare against annexation for fear it will be said that they are trying to interfere with the just prosecution of the war. but that they may be discussed in times of profound peace. under congenial surroundings. when the judgment of the people as finally given will be their enlightened and judicial judgment. Then. if they deliberately favor this crusade for empire. we must acquiesce and go forward in it cheerfully. whatever dangers it may bring to us. but if they then hesitate. they will have an opportunity to carefully investigate and exercise their free choice before gyves are put upon them by their Representatives and Senators in Congress Mr. Speaker. I do not believe that the masses of our countrymen favor this annexation. I do not accept the opinion of the Chief Executive as a just exposition of their views. Neither the clamor of certain of the press nor the demands of military and naval dignitaries should conclude them. But. even if the majority of our constituents are inclined to this measure. and we believe their conclusion to have been reached without having the facts fully presented for their consideration. and that annexation will result in their injury and to the damageof our country. it should still be our high prerogative and our bounden duty to interpose a barrier between them and the evil they are about to embrace. until they have had the opportunity to review their opinions and make a final decision in the light of all the evidence. I protest also against efforts which have been made. both here and elsewhere. to make it appear that Hawaiian annexation is a party question and that the tenets of the Republican party require it to be accomplished. I grant you that the gentleman from Ohio [MIr. GnoSvExoR] disavowed the political character of the question the other day upon this floor. He was too shrewd a man to be caught in a trap like that. He no doubt had in mind while he was speaking the declaration of the last Republican national convention upon this subject. and besides he doubtless thought that he could afford by his admission to allow several gentlemen upon this side to vote against annexation and to exercise the liberty of their consciences. so far as party discipline was concerned. if he could only be able to woo to his support some gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber. But I say to the gentleman from Ohio. and I say it respectfully. that of all men upon the floor. he is the least likely. because of his known partisan views. to receive very much consideration upon this subject at the hands of those upon the other side of the center aisle. But. sir. you have heard it through the press. you have heard it in private conversation. you have heard it in public discussions. it has been dinned in your ears everywhere. that Hawaiian annexation is a Republican measure. that the Republican party is in favor of it. that the President of the United States. who seems disposed to urge this matter. whatever may betide. is committed to it. and that we ought loyally to uphold the hands of the President. and that he is derelict in duty. not only to the Republican party. but also to the country. who will withhold this support. Unfortunately for this contention the declarations of the Republican party in its last national convention assembled are in point. When Benjamin Harrison. a Republican President. sent the first annexation treaty to the Senate. and Grover Cleveland. in the exercise of his good. rugged common sense. withdrew that treaty from its consideration. an issue upon annexation was joined between the Republican President upon the one side and the Democratic President upon the other. and the Republican party was invited to define its position in the matter. At the very next Republican national convention which assembled. the one which nominated the present occupant of the White House for the position of the Presidency. that convention. thus challenged to declare itself. responded. But how? Did it demand annexation? Upon the contrary. it carefully avoided any such a demand. It simply declared that it was in favor of the United States controlling the island. and against ttLe intervention in its affairs by any foreign nation. And. as if to show that it understood the meaning of words and used them advisedly. in the very next section it declared that the Nicaraguan Canal should be ""owned"" by the United States. Mr. Speaker. who will pretend that this high declaration of Republican principles. by that organization in the party which alone has authority to declare its principles. commits the Republican party to the project to annex Hawaii? Mr. Harrison had no right to commit the Republican party to the proposition. though he possessed the clear right to his opinion concerning it and the constitutional power to negotiate the treaty by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. and I respectfully call the attention of the very excellent gentleman who is his successor and who is now in the White House to the fact that the position of the Republican party is to be defined by the party organization and not by the man whom it elects President. and he will do well in this peculiar juncture of human affairs to remember that whatever his action may be now. however the voice of censure in his party may be withheld from him at the present. there will come a time when every act of his Administration will be reviewed. not only by those opposed to him politically. but in the spirit of manly criticism and fairness by those inside the pale of his own party organization. who will not hesitate to denounce any action upon his part which in their honest judgment they deem to have been in violation of the best interests of the American people. Now. Mr. Speaker. I propose to consider the second proposition which I laid down when I commenced my argument. I affirm that the annexation of Hawaii is not necessary to us in order to prevent it passing into the hands of any other nation. that there is no danger that it will be used in the future as a base from which to assail our coast if we now reject it. Here is theargument that is made: We are told that foreign vessels of war can not carry sufficient coal to enable them to cross the Pacific Ocean and attack our western coast. that Hawaii is the only place where such vessels can replenish with coal for such hostile purpose. that it commands our shores and can be used as a base for prosecuting war against us. hence that we must annex it in order to stop supply of coal to foreigners and prevent it from being made a base for their warfare upon us. We are told that if we will do this that foreign fleets will be powerless for lack of coal. and will lie ""like painted ships upon a painted sea. "" Of course. sir. such an argument as this can have no application to the mother country. with whom. of all nations on earth. war is most to be dreaded. for in British Columbia. upon the Pacific coast. right above our domain. she has a strongly fortified base of supplies to which her vessels could resort to obtain coal. and from which they could come forth to menace and attack our coast. But these advocates of imperialism are telling us. in answer to this suggestion. that the English coaling station. strongly fortified though it he. would not amount to anything to England in case of war with us. for the reason that at the very opening of the war we would take possession of it. Alh. MIr. Speaker. I want to call the attention of these omniscient gentlemen] to the fact that we found it a good deal easier to boast what we would do before the opening of the present war. in the way of taking possession of the enemys country. than it has been to perform that act since the war has come upon us. We were going to seize Cuba in a few short hours and pull down the Spanish flag and emancipate the Cuban patriots without delay. But nearly two months have elapsed since war was declared and still we have been unable to find permanent lodgement upon Cuban soil. Spain is one nation. England is quite another. She is mighty upon both land and sea. and she could not be dislodged from British Columbia except after great expenditure of treasure and of blood. and after a considerable ]apse of time. Mr. Speaker. I make bold to asser~t that I would not regard it as a great national calamity if some foreign nation should get per[manent possession of the Hawaiian Islands. I am one of th~ose who do not believe that this great Republic would perish or even that our safety would be seriously endangered by such an event. iWith a standing army of reasonable size. at all times well armed and equipped. with a strong Navy and coast defenses adequate and effcient. all of which equipment could be maintained at a far less expense than would be necessary if we were to embark upon this policy of territorial acquisition. I do not doubt that with our vast population. our immense resources. our base of supplies behind us. and our line of communication open and incapable of interruption. we could maintain ourselves with ease against the owners of this isle. The logic which insists that we shall possess ourselves of Hawaii upon the ground that it can be used as a basis for menacing our coast proves too much. It goes too far. The same logic carried to its natural conclusion would require us to dislodge England from British Columbia in the Pacific and from Halifax and the Bermdas in the Atlantic. where for years she has held strongly fortified positions within easy range of our shores. Let me call gentlemens attention to this very significant fact. that we have had within easy striking distance of us for years these fortified strongholds of this powerful nation. and yet for nearly a century we have not had a single war with her. She has during all this period been unable to oppress us or deprive us of our rights. Every controversy we have had with her has been settled amicably and by the peaceful arts of arbitration. instead of resorting to bloodshed and the sword. In these modern days. sir. it does not follow of necessity that ""land intersected by a narrow frith abhor each other."" It is possible to occupy adjacent territory and still preserve peace. All depends. of course. largely upon the circumstances of each particular case. I am well aware. M r. Speaker. that distinguished military and naval gentlemen disagree with me in the position that it is not necessary for us to own Hawaii in order to protect ourselves against foreign nations. These gentlemen are in the habit of looking upon those who disagree with them in this matter. or in any other matter relating to our relations with other nations. for that matter. with a species of conpassion that borders very closely upon contempt. I do not attempt. sir. to disparage the services that have been rendered our country by our military and naval officers. They have always done their duty nobly in the past. and are doing it now with heroic courage. We can at all times depend upon them to valorously maintain the integrity of the country and the honor of the countrys flag. whatever nay be our territorial policy in the future. But it is well enough for us to remember that these gentlemen are but humanthat they are by no means infallible. They have imbibed certain ideas from their education. Bred to arms is it at all surprising that they should desire that which will give them opportunities for employment and distinction? In times of profound peace. when our Army and Navy is small. and when we have no colonial possessions to garrison. Othellos occupation is gone. and the opportunities for promotion are few and far between. Under such conditions one may serve in the Army or Navy until his head is white with age and yet attain to no very high rank. But if we enter upon a colonial policy. and have vast possessions. maintained by great armies and great navies. opportunities for employment and for honorable distinction in the countrys service are multiplied. promotions become rapid. and Othellos occupation is resumed. We should remember these considerations. sir. and weigh with a grain of allowance what these officers of the Army and Navy say upon certain subjects. They are but a small portion of our population of 70.000.000 people. and others are quite likely to have sensible opinions on subjects which. I fear. they are inclined to arrogate wholly to themselves. Even upon military and naval affairs we are not required to abdicate our judgment entirely. We must reserve the right to test their opinions by our judgments. Certainly. on the question of annexations and their wisdom there is no monopoly of information. nothing so technical that the lay mind can not form quite an intelligent opinion concerning it. One does not have to be a graduate of West Point or Annapolis to be able to read the pages of history aright and to draw from them accurate and useful lessons as to the effect of territorial and provincial holdings upon the destiny of nations. Our military and naval officers may declare until they are red in the face. as they did before the Committee on Foreign Affairs. that we will require a less navy instead of a greater one after we have annexed Hawaii. and you and I are at liberty to believe it or not. as we see fit. They may assert over and over again that the possession of insular territory will add to our happiness. prosperity. and power as a people. and still we are not concluded by their opinion. But to get back to the point at issue. It is claimed that if we do not annex Hawaii its people will voluntarily transfer the island to some other power. Mr. Speaker. I deny it. The whole history of Hawaii shows that such action is wholly improbable. Through all the political vicissitudes of that people. under all the forms of government under which they have existed. whether native or white. oligarchical or republican. if there is any one thing above all others which has particularly distinguished them it has been their desire for independence of all governments except our own. N ever have they manifested the least inclination to join their fortunes to that of any other nation on earth than ours. They have vigorously resisted at all times any suggestion of foreign domination by other countries. Their disposition and their trade has uniformly been toward us. They have had no inclination whatever toward the great nations of the Old World. from whom they are separated by thousands of miles of water. For years their absolute independence has been guaranteed by the United States and by a joint treaty entered into between England and France. and they have all along had every reason to believe that there was no likelihood of that independence being interfered with. Are we to believe. then. that just at this time they are suddenly disposed. when no nation is moving against them. when the treaty between England and France is still in force. and when we. stronger and greater than ever before. are still guaranteeing their freedom. they will consent to transfer themselves to some other country simply because we do not accept them? The idea. sir. is preposterous. as preposterous as many other of the assertions whereby men are sought to be carried off their feet in considering this important measure. which ought to receive the closest scrutiny. and which no man should act upon without having first canvassed the whole ground. so as to be sure that he is absolutely right. Why. if there is any doubt upon this point as to what is the in clination of these people on this subject. look at the declarations of President Dole. They ought to be good authority for annexationists on this floor. In an interview submitted to by him at the hands of a reporter on the occasion of his recent visit to this country. an interview which occurred in Chicago and was published in the New York Journal of the 24th of last January. he was asked what would happen in the event that the United States rejected annexation. He answered. ""Well. the Republic is there. I do not know that anything would happen. except that things would go on as usual. I do not see any immediate danger from possession by any other country."" And yet there are those who conjure up this bugaboo to frighten gentlemen from the discharge of their duty and coerce weak minds which they can see in advance have not the strength to withstand such miserable claptrap. If. however. these people would not voluntarily surrender their autonomy. is there still danger that a foreign power may seize and hold Hawaii agaipst their willforcibly annex it. and thus obtain a base of operatiois against us in case of war with us? This pretense has also been made. sir. When the report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs was made to the Senate on a resolution for annexation of Hawaii. there was written in the report a statement that England had designs upon the island. But. sir. the ink upon the paper that contained that declaration was scarcely dry before Sir Julian Pauncefote. pursuant to instructions from his Government. hastened to make known to the United States that nothing of that kind was intended and to disavow all such purposes. On several occasions after this the leaders of the English Parliament rose in answer to interrogatories and made the same frank disavowal. The idea. Mr. Speaker. is inconsistent with everything England has done with respect to the islands. Her treaty with France in 1843. to which I have already alluded and which she at the time asked us to join. and which she again solicited us to join as late as 1887. and her uniform observance of its terms for fiftyfive years is pregnant evidence of the falsity of this accusation made against her by the report of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs. It has also been claimed that the Japanese were trying to colonize the island with a view of getting it under control and then turning it over to Japan. I think the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs made an intimation of that kind when he addressed this House on last Friday. Certainly the Japanese could not do this by peaceful methods. for in response to my question the gentleman admitted that. under the constitution and laws of Hawaii. the Japanese had not the right to vote. It is not denied that they are most of them on the island as contract laborers under a seven years contract. without any political rights whatever. No sooner. sir. had this claim been made than the Japanese minister hastened to make a disavowal. not only on his own account. but for his Government. He pointed out that the only trouble was that Hawaii herself had invited the Japandse by a treaty to immigrate there. and that they had gone in pursuance of that request. and that subsequently Hawaii had arbitrarily undertaken to expel them. Japan then did what any other nation on the globe would have done. demanded an indemnity. which Hawaii proposed to arbitrate. and which proposal Japan accepted. The Japanese minister has further pointed out to us that Japan does not favor emigration of her people and that it has never been her policy to extend her territory beyond the zone which immediately surrounds her. He has also declared that Japan had no designs whatever upon Hawaiihas expressly repudiated the entire charge. and thus is exploded another of the false pretenses by which we are sought to be pushed into rash and precipitate action in the passage of the pending resolution. Now. Mr. Speaker. I assert that there never has been but one instanceand if I am wrong I submit to correction. probably I had better say that there never has been but one instance that has come to my knowledgewhere any nation has undertaken to seize Hawaii with the intention of retaining it. Indeed. even in this instance the nation whose officer committed the act disavowed it. What are the historical facts? In 1839 a French vessel landed there. not to seize the island. to take possession of it permanently for the French Government. but simply for the purpose of redressing oppressions which were being committed on converts on the island made by the Spanish priests. and the purpose having been accomplished this vessel instantly withdrew. In 1843 a British vessel sailed into the harbor of Honolulu and her captain extorted a deed of cession of Hawaii from the king. drew down the ensign of the island and ran up the British flag. but upon a mere protest. unaccompanied by threat or show of force on the part of our Government. in less than four weeks the British disavowed the act. and the flag of Great Britain was drawn down. the Hawaiian flag run up again. and the island left in possession of its rightful owners. In this very year. 1843. Mr. Speaker. as I have already said. the British Government entered into a treaty with France whereby they forever guaranteed the independence of Hawaii and bound themselves never in any manner to take possession of any part of it. Upon England inviting us to become a party to this agreement. we declined to do so. but our Secretary of State at the time declared in effect that we were in sympathy with the proposition and that it conformed to the American policy. That treaty stands today unabrogated and observed. As late as 1887 England again approached us and asked us to join in a treaty with France. Germany. and herself. guaranteeing the independence of Hawaii. Again we declined. at the same time reiterating the declaration of our traditional policy in favor of the absolute independence of the island. I believe. sir. that there was one other instance subsequent to thisprobably in the year 1849. Some French vessels. for some alleged grievances which Hawaii was unwilling to admit. landed men upon the island. took possession of the Government buildings. and remained there for some time. But these Frenchmen never pulled down the Hawaiian flag. and they finally left. They declared to England they had not violated either the spirit or letter of the treaty and had never intended to do sohad never intended to take permanent possession of the island. They cited as evidence of this fact that they had not pulled down the flag of Hawaii or raised the French flag in its plate and that they had retired from the island. Does any man on this floor dare to tell me that when for a vast number of years our declaration to the world that the independence of Hawaii should be maintained has been accepted and acquiesced in by all nationsa declaration made when we were a young country. a weak country. without much of an army. and with a navy of small proportionsnow. when we have grown to be a powerful nation of 70.000.000 people. with vast and illimitable resources. with a great navy. and with a capacity to raise and equip in a few short months an immense armythat now these nations are getting ready to depart from their old course of conduct and to seize this island and hold it as a base from which to attack our coast? The claim is absolutely preposterous. It shows how hard pressed these annexationists are for arguments that they resort to such a pretense as this for the purpose of blinding the intelligence of the people upon a question so important. Mr. Speaker. our traditional doctrine. down to the time that this policy of annexation has been agitated within the last few years. has always been in favor not of the annexation but of the independence of Hawaii. The utterances of our Presidents. of our Secretaries of State. of our diplomats. of our publicists. of our legislators down until this desire for new empire has taken possession of the minds of some of our people. have been. with but few exceptions. in favor of simple independence. As late as 1894. this House and the body at the other end of the Capitol practically reiterated this doctrine in separate resolutions which were passed by the respective Houses. Sir. pass the resolution which the minority offers in this instance as a substitute for the annexation resolution of the majority. declare to Hawaii and the world once more our old doctrine that we guarantee the independence of the island and will maintain the same. and that no foreign nation must lay hands on it. and there is not a power in the world that would dare to vi6late the declaration. because it would know that a violation of it simply meant a terrible and destructive wax with the greatest nation of modern times. But if there is any doubt upon this point. how easy it would be to settle it by an amicable arrangement. I myself had the honor to introduce into this House a joint resolution. now pending before the Committee on Foreign Affairs. which provides that the President of the United States shall appoint three commissioners on behalf of the United States to meet a like number of commissioners from each one of the leading nations of the world. at a conveniently early day. at Washington. to formulate a plan for an agreement. to be reported back to the respective governments for their adoption. forever guaranteeing the entire independence of Hawaii. and prohibiting the taking possession of any part of its soil. There is not a nation on the face of the earth that would not be willing to accept an agreement containing this proposition. England is committed to the principle. France is committed to it. Japan is committed to it. 1 assume. sir. that the President would be willing to negotiate a treaty upon the basis of such a plan if Congress passed this resolution. that. even if he did not sign it. he would be disposed to accept it as an expression of popular will. and take the initiative in the matter. thus obviating any constitutional objections. if such exist. to the joint resolution. Mark you. I do not say that such an agreement is necessary. for I do not believe the possession of these islands is essential to our safety. I do not believe the people of Hawaii. if we reject this proposition. will ever give themselves away to any other nation. I have demonstrated. I think. quite conclusively that there is no danger that any other nation will step in and undertake to take possession of it by force. But. I say. if anyone has any fears on this subject. here is a proposition which will accomplish the very purpose of annexation. prevent this island from falling into the hands of any foreign country. and at the same time relieve us from the terrible burdens that would come from annexing it to the United States. With this proposition agreed to by every nation. making this solemn guaranty. there is not a country in the whole compact that would ever dare attempt. in case of war. to seize the island as a base for operations against us. Such an attempt would call down not only our own resentment and the resentment of the people of Hawaii. but the resentment and interposition of the other nations that were parties to the agreement. Ah. but I have been told by gentlemen to whom this plan has been submitted that it involves ""entangling alliances"" with foreign powersthe very thing that we have been warned against by Washington in his memorable Farewell Address. Entangling alliances! Why. the very purpose is to prevent entangling alliances and things infinitely worse. Entangling alliances! It is just such an alliance as we have today with many nations upon various subjects which concern us. and if I mistake not is something akin to the alliance which we have at this time with certain nations with respect to our rights and their rights in the island of Samoa. I have been told. too. that it involves a surrender of the Monroe doctrine. Mr. Speaker. I have never yet been able to find two gentlemen who could agree in their definition of this famous doctrine. It certainly is a very elastic doctrine which can be extended 2.200 miles out into the Pacific Ocean. But admitting that it is capable of such expansion. let us stop. and consider for a moment whether this objection that has been suggested to the scheme is tenable. I took great pleasure in reading the other day a memorable speech delivered by Mr. Calhoun in 1848 in the Senate of the United States. a speech which I had read once before years ago. containing an exposition of the Monroe doctrine. He points out very clearly in this speech that which a certain jingo element in this country would do well just at this crisis of public affairs to observe. that this doctrine had frequently been misconceived and misconstrued. and that individuals had often sought to extend it far beyond its proper scope and in a manner that was extremely dangerous to the country. He declared that as construed by some the doctrine would put it in the power of every petty South American country to involve us in all its wars. He further declared that the Monroe doctrine did not arbitrarily make each occupation of territory in this hemisphere a cause for offense and resistance by us. but that whether an occupation was to be so regarded and treated must depend upon the facts in each particular case. and he then went on to define the doctrine as involving three principles. What were they? First. that the Holy Alliance. formed after the overthrow of Napoleon by certain European nations. the object of which was to discourage republican institutions and to promote monarchical institutions. and which was particularly aimed at that time. so far as this hemisphere was concerned. at the provinces of Spain in South America. should not enforce its peculiar tenets in the Western Hemisphere. second. that there should be no oppression by the nations of the Old World of the people of this hemisphere. and third. that there should be no colonization by foreign nations upon this hemisphere. whether upon land that was previously occupied or land that was unoccupied. Now. tell me. gentlemen. if you please. which one of these three principles the plan I have suggested for the neutralization of the Hawaiian islands violates?",1898-06-15,Mr. JOHNSON of Indiana,R,6.0,HENRY,JOHNSON,H,M,IN
